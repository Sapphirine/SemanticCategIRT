To run frontend:
Source code is BigDataFrontend.py
Files are stored in run directory
"Stage3FF" is the final reorganized dataset.

Frontend demo link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxVDNO11sDM&feature=youtu.be

To run backend:
Source code is contained in src
For demos run shell scripts with files available in corpora-proc folder
(the data in/out folder):

"vlsi.txt" for vlsi-demo.sh
"human_cloning.txt" for do-human-cloning-LDA.sh

Filtering and initial kmeans are shared between the Segmentation pipeline
(vlsi-demo.sh) and LDA pipeline (do-human-cloning-LDA.sh).

The former will then run segmentation code from:
https://github.com/alexalemi/segmentation
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.05543v1.pdf

and the latter multicore LDA:
