-=-=-TEXT: Very-large-scale integration (VLSI) is the process of creating an integrated circuit (IC) by combining thousands of transistors into a single chip. VLSI began in the 1970s when complex semiconductor and communication technologies were being developed. The microprocessor is a VLSI device. Before the introduction of VLSI technology most ICs had a limited set of functions they could perform. An electronic circuit might consist of a CPU, ROM, RAM and other glue logic. VLSI lets IC designers add all of these into one chip
During the mid-1920s, several inventors attempted devices that were intended to control current in solid-state diodes and convert them into triodes. Success did not come until after WWII, during which the attempt to improve silicon and germanium crystals for use as radar detectors led to improvements in fabrication and in the understanding of quantum mechanical states of carriers in semiconductors. Then scientists who had been diverted to radar development returned to solid-state device development. With the invention of transistors at Bell Labs in 1947, the field of electronics shifted from vacuum tubes to solid-state devices.
With the small transistor at their hands, electrical engineers of the 1950s saw the possibilities of constructing far more advanced circuits. As the complexity of circuits grew, problems arose.[1]
One problem was the size of the circuit. A complex circuit, like a computer, was dependent on speed. If the components of the computer were too large or the wires interconnecting them too long, the electric signals couldn't travel fast enough through the circuit, thus making the computer too slow to be effective.[1]
Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments found a solution to this problem in 1958. Kilby's idea was to make all the components and the chip out of the same block (monolith) of semiconductor material. Kilby presented his idea to his superiors, and was allowed to build a test version of his circuit. In September 1958, he had his first integrated circuit ready.[1] Although the first integrated circuit was crude and had some problems, the idea was groundbreaking. By making all the parts out of the same block of material and adding the metal needed to connect them as a layer on top of it, there was no need for discrete components. No more wires and components had to be assembled manually. The circuits could be made smaller, and the manufacturing process could be automated. From here, the idea of integrating all components on a single silicon wafer came into existence, which led to development in small-scale integration (SSI) in the early 1960s, medium-scale integration (MSI) in the late 1960s, and then large-scale integration (LSI) as well as VLSI in the 1970s and 1980s, with tens of thousands of transistors on a single chip (later hundreds of thousands, then millions, and now billions (109)).
In order to produce the guidance computers for its Polaris missiles, the US Navy is rumored to have financed the miniaturization of electronic circuits. This work is still classified, but the Polaris A1 was launched in 1960 and the long-range Polaris A2 went into service in 1962. It is publically known that the D-17B computer was developed for the guidance system of the Minuteman I, but nothing has come out about the guidance system of the Polaris A1, A2 or A3. There are stories[citation needed] of job interviewees at Texas Instruments being shown an IBM 7094 equivalent the size of a desktop ornament in the 1960s. Also unknown is whether any of this knowledge found its way into the commercial world. We do know that the Soviets also developed a submarine-launched ballistic missile R-29 Vysota.
The first semiconductor chips held two transistors each. Subsequent advances added more transistors, and as a consequence, more individual functions or systems were integrated over time. The first integrated circuits held only a few devices, perhaps as many as ten diodes, transistors, resistors and capacitors, making it possible to fabricate one or more logic gates on a single device. Now known retrospectively as small-scale integration (SSI), improvements in technique led to devices with hundreds of logic gates, known as medium-scale integration (MSI). Further improvements led to large-scale integration (LSI), i.e. systems with at least a thousand logic gates. Current technology has moved far past this mark and today's microprocessors have many millions of gates and billions of individual transistors.
At one time, there was an effort to name and calibrate various levels of large-scale integration above VLSI. Terms like ultra-large-scale integration (ULSI) were used. But the huge number of gates and transistors available on common devices has rendered such fine distinctions moot. Terms suggesting greater than VLSI levels of integration are no longer in widespread use.
As of early 2008, billion-transistor processors are commercially available. This became more commonplace as semiconductor fabrication advanced from the then-current generation of 65 nm processes. Current designs, unlike the earliest devices, use extensive design automation and automated logic synthesis to lay out the transistors, enabling higher levels of complexity in the resulting logic functionality. Certain high-performance logic blocks like the SRAM (static random-access memory) cell, are still designed by hand to ensure the highest efficiency. VLSI technology may be moving toward further radical miniaturization with introduction of NEMS technology.
Structured VLSI design is a modular methodology originated by Carver Mead and Lynn Conway for saving microchip area by minimizing the interconnect fabrics area. This is obtained by repetitive arrangement of rectangular macro blocks which can be interconnected using wiring by abutment. An example is partitioning the layout of an adder into a row of equal bit slices cells. In complex designs this structuring may be achieved by hierarchical nesting.[citation needed]
Structured VLSI design had been popular in the early 1980s, but lost its popularity later because of the advent of placement and routing tools wasting a lot of area by routing, which is tolerated because of the progress of Moore's Law. When introducing the hardware description language KARL in the mid' 1970s, Reiner Hartenstein coined the term "structured VLSI design" (originally as "structured LSI design"), echoing Edsger Dijkstra's structured programming approach by procedure nesting to avoid chaotic spaghetti-structured programs.
As microprocessors become more complex due to technology scaling, microprocessor designers have encountered several challenges which force them to think beyond the design plane, and look ahead to post-silicon:
Process variation – As photolithography techniques tend closer to the fundamental laws of optics, achieving high accuracy in doping concentrations and etched wires is becoming more difficult and prone to errors due to variation. Designers now must simulate across multiple fabrication process corners before a chip is certified ready for production.
Stricter design rules – Due to lithography and etch issues with scaling, design rules for layout have become increasingly stringent. Designers must keep ever more of these rules in mind while laying out custom circuits. The overhead for custom design is now reaching a tipping point, with many design houses opting to switch to electronic design automation (EDA) tools to automate their design process.
Timing/design closure – As clock frequencies tend to scale up, designers are finding it more difficult to distribute and maintain low clock skew between these high frequency clocks across the entire chip. This has led to a rising interest in multicore and multiprocessor architectures, since an overall speedup can be obtained by lowering the clock frequency and distributing processing.
First-pass success – As die sizes shrink (due to scaling), and wafer sizes go up (due to lower manufacturing costs), the number of dies per wafer increases, and the complexity of making suitable photomasks goes up rapidly. A mask set for a modern technology can cost several million dollars. This non-recurring expense deters the old iterative philosophy involving several "spin-cycles" to find errors in silicon, and encourages first-pass silicon success. Several design philosophies have been developed to aid this new design flow, including design for manufacturing (DFM), design for test (DFT), and Design for X.

-=-=-TEXT: VLSI Technology, Inc was a company which designed and manufactured custom and semi-custom ICs. The company was based in Silicon Valley, with headquarters at 1109 McKay Drive in San Jose, California. Along with LSI Logic, VLSI Technology defined the leading edge of the application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) business, which accelerated the push of powerful embedded systems into affordable products.
VLSI was acquired in June 1999 for about $1 billion by Philips Electronics and is today a part of the Philips spin-off NXP Semiconductors.
The company was founded in 1979 by a trio from Fairchild Semiconductor by way of Synertek – Jack Balletto, Dan Floyd, and Gunnar Wetlesen – and by Doug Fairbairn of Xerox PARC and Lambda (later VLSI Design) magazine.
Alfred J. Stein became the CEO of the company in 1982. Subsequently VLSI built its first fab in San Jose; eventually a second fab was built in San Antonio, Texas. VLSI had its initial public offering in 1983, and was listed on the stock market as (NASDAQ: VLSI). The company was later acquired by Philips and survives to this day as part of NXP Semiconductors.
The original business plan was to be a contract wafer fabrication company, but the venture investors wanted the company to develop IC (Integrated Circuit) design tools to help fill the foundry.
Thanks to its Caltech and UC Berkeley students, VLSI was an important pioneer in the electronic design automation (EDA) industry. It offered a sophisticated package of tools, originally based on the 'lambda-based' design style advocated by Carver Mead and Lynn Conway.
VLSI became an early vendor of standard cell (cell-based technology) to the merchant market in the early 80s where the other ASIC-focused company, LSI Logic, was a leader in gate arrays. Prior to VLSI's cell-based offering, the technology had been primarily available only within large vertically integrated companies with semiconductor units such as AT&T and IBM.
VLSI's design tools included not only design entry and simulation but eventually also cell-based routing (chip compiler), a datapath compiler, SRAM and ROM compilers, and a state machine compiler. The tools were an integrated design solution for IC design and not just point tools, or more general purpose system tools. A designer could edit transistor-level polygons and/or logic schematics, then run DRC and LVS, extract parasitics from the layout and run Spice simulation, then back-annotate the timing or gate size changes into the logic schematic database. Characterization tools were integrated to generate FrameMaker Data Sheets for Libraries. VLSI eventually spun off the CAD and Library operation into Compass Design Automation but it never reached IPO before it was purchased by Avanti Corp.
VLSI's physical design tools were critical not only to its ASIC business, but also in setting the bar for the commercial electronic design automation (EDA) industry. When VLSI and its main ASIC competitor, LSI Logic, were establishing the ASIC industry, commercially-available tools could not deliver the productivity necessary to support the physical design of hundreds of ASIC designs each year without the deployment of a substantial number of layout engineers. The companies' development of automated layout tools was a rational "make because there's nothing to buy" decision. The EDA industry finally caught up in the late 1980s when Tangent Systems released its TanCell and TanGate products. In 1989, Tangent was acquired by Cadence Design Systems (founded in 1988).
Unfortunately, for all VLSI's initial competence in design tools, they were not leaders in semiconductor manufacturing technology. VLSI had not been timely in developing a 1.0 µm manufacturing process as the rest of the industry moved to that geometry in the late 80s. VLSI entered a long-term technology parthership with Hitachi and finally released a 1.0 µm process and cell library (actually more of a 1.2 µm library with a 1.0 µm gate).
As VLSI struggled to gain parity with the rest of the industry in semiconductor technology, the design flow was moving rapidly to a Verilog HDL and synthesis flow. Cadence acquired Gateway, the leader in Verilog hardware design language (HDL) and Synopsys was dominating the exploding field of design synthesis. As VLSI's tools were being eclipsed, VLSI waited too long to open the tools up to other fabs and Compass Design Automation was never a viable competitor to industry leaders.
Meanwhile, VLSI entered the merchant high speed static RAM (SRAM) market as they needed a product to drive the semiconductor process technology development. All the large semiconductor companies built high speed SRAMs with cost structures VLSI could never match. VLSI withdrew once it was clear that the Hitachi process technology partnership was working.
ARM Ltd was formed in 1990 as a semiconductor intellectual property licensor, backed by Acorn, Apple and VLSI. VLSI became a licensee of the powerful ARM processor and ARM finally funded processor tools. Initial adoption of the ARM processor was slow. Few applications could justify the overhead of an embedded 32 bit processor. In fact, despite the addition of further licensees, the ARM processor enjoyed little market success until they developed the novel 'thumb' extensions. Ericsson adopted the ARM processor in a VLSI chipset for its GSM handset designs in the early 1990s. It was the GSM boost that is the foundation of ARM the company/technology that it is today.
Only in PC chipsets, did VLSI dominate in the early 90s. This product was developed by five engineers using the 'Megacells" in the VLSI library that led to a business unit at VLSI that almost equaled its ASIC business in revenue. VLSI eventually ceded the market to Intel because Intel was able to package-sell its processors, chipsets, and even board level products together.
VLSI also had an early partnership with PMC, a design group that had been nurtured of British Columbia Bell. When PMC wanted to divest its semiconductor intellectual property venture, VLSI's bid was beaten by a creative deal by Sierra Semiconductor. The telecom business unit management at VLSI opted to go it alone. PMC Sierra became one of the most important telecom ASSP vendors.
Scientists and innovations from the 'design technology' part of VLSI found their way to Cadence Design Systems (by way of Redwood Design Automation). Compass Design Automation (VLSI's CAD and Library spin-off) was sold to Avant! Corporation, which itself was acquired by Synopsys.
VLSI maintained operations throughout the USA, and in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore and Taiwan. One of its key sites was in Tempe, Arizona, where a family of highly successful chipsets was developed for the IBM PC.
In 1990, VLSI Technology, along with Acorn Computers and Apple Computer were the founding investing partners in ARM Ltd.
Ericsson of Sweden, after many years of collaboration, was by 1998 VLSI's largest customer, with annual revenue of $120 million. VLSI's datapath compiler (VDP) was the value-added differentiator that opened the door at Ericsson in 1987/8. The silicon revenue and GPM enabled by VDP must make it one of the most successful pieces of customer-configurable, non-memory silicon intellectual property (SIP) in the history of the industry. Within the Wireless Products division, based at Sophia-Antipolis in France, VLSI developed a range of algorithms and circuits for the GSM standard and for cordless standards such as the European DECT and the Japanese PHS.
Stimulated by its growth and success in the wireless handset IC area, Philips Electronics acquired VLSI in June 1999, for about $1 billion. The former components survive to this day as part of Philips spin-off NXP Semiconductors.

-=-=-TEXT: "Or maybe a WWI infantry charge is just like a modern tank brigade plus air support coming at you. Who knows."
As one who has both modern military experience that is still current *and* current, bleeding edge IT experience, we'll suffice it to say, I understand both viewpoints and you do not.
The tank brigade would be countered with covered pits, for the infantry to engage inside of the blind zone of the tanks, within danger close of the tanks from the air support.
The IT addressed similarly. I've done the latter, cutting loose the hopelessly obsolete and overly expensive, protecting the worthwhile, pending porting to a more modern and more inexpensive, but effective platform.
So, I'll say, I can out-script you in the environment of your choice, I can outfight whatever military force you choose. I can out-fart you, but then, I'm a lot older than you. Arthritis is also an issue, but it's more an annoyance that triggers adrenaline and increases strength.
The latter being of note by my ability to throw a 20 stone man into an object within two meters and change and disable that man.
Now, I'm not suggesting violence. I'm suggesting a certain specific experience set that you badly lack.
I've worked with ancient IT, I work with modern IT. I've worked with specialist warfare teams.
I far prefer the IT environment, ancient tech present or not.
I know how to handle ancient and get it ported to more sustainable technology that wouldn't bankrupt the Crown of England.
In a couple of decades, you just *might* accomplish that, if you learn to actually learn old and new things.
I'm also proficient with vacuum tube technology, germanium transistor technology and VLSI technology, working with all of the above.
So, I'll suggest you do one thing: "Open your mind".
For, closed minds are the path to extinction.
Still, it's only a suggestion.

Wherever you go, you are surrounded by  the sound. From the moment your alarm clock wakes you up, sound follows you everywhere on the Internet radio, car stereo, traffic lights, portable stereo, mobile phone, talking ATM, elevator, TV set, baby monitor, Hi-Fi equipment, toys, and many other devices.  
We at VLSI Solution are part of this development. Our high-quality audio integrated circuit products help you put audio everywhere from toys to High-end Hi-Fi equipment. 
VS1005 is the new flagship audio product of VLSI Solution. It is probably the world's highest integrated  system-on-silicon device for personal music players. See our MP3 player presentation. A Developer Board as well as engineering samples for VS1005 are now available. 
VS23S010  is the world's largest capacity, 1 Mbit, SPI RAM. It is perfect for  microcontroller memory expansion applications, like internet stream  buffering. Samples are available.
VS1063 is an MP3 encoder/decoder IC. It's a pin-compatible replacement for VS1053 with many added features, ranging from a speed shifter and 5-channel equalizer to a whole new full duplex codec mode. See our internet streaming presentation. 
VS1000  is a license free  audio player SoC. It is intended for content sellers  such as audio books, tourist guides, announcement systems and intelligent toys.
VS1053 is a high performance decoder and encoder chip for audio streaming applications such as internet radio. VS1053 has multi-format decoding capability and customization by using our IDE. This makes it attractive for the commodity MP3 player market as well.
VS1003 is a high quality MP3+WMA decoder. It is ideal for small micro SD card based player applications. Additionally audio processing power of the device can be used for DSP applications such as adaptive echo cancellation for Skype speaker phones.
VS1103 is for effect processing such as reverb, echo cancellation, PCM recording, MIDI synthesis and simple pitch shifting. Like VS1003 it offers very simple SD card based player applications but with less cost because VS1103 does not need an MP3 decoder  license.
VS1011 is a very popular MP3 decoder. It is very simple to use as an audio interface of a master processor.
The VSMD001 family is a small, high performance, easy to use  Ogg Vorbis audio player that is controlled from the IO pins, UART, SPI or USB. It  can be used as a "plug-in" audio board in electronic systems or as a  standalone small audio player. The audio content can locate either in the embedded  SPI nor flash or in a micro SD card. 
The VSMD301 family has power and audio pins compatible with VSMD001 family. Features are similar as in VSMD001 family. It lacks USB interface of the other family  but has mono ADC with microphone amplifier for recording or mixing. VSMD301 family uses PCM or ADPCM format for audio content. Simple audio format provides low audio delay and  seamless looping capability.
The VS1053b USB Hi-Fi Player is a multi-format "MP3 player" that uses  the VS1053 as a stand-alone component along with a low-cost High Speed  (480 Mbit/s) USB controller. The device can play .MP3, .OGG, .AAC, .M4A,  .WMA, .WAV, .IMA and .MID files with excellent sound quality. It can either use SD/SDHC cards (over 2 GB supported) or internal FLASH  memory.
The HiFi Recorder Application demonstrates the capabilities of VS1000d  and VS1053b chips for high quality stereo recording from line-in or microphone interface.
VS1003 SD Card Mini Player application is an  extremely simple SD card player. It features mp3 and WMA audio formats,  small size, excellent audio quality. It is likely the  simplest, smallest and lowest cost SD card player in the world.
VS1000 Button Cell Player application is a very low power audio player. It features Ogg Vorbis decoding with  very low bit rates and  credit card size. The low BOM   of less than 3 USD and royalty free audio compression make it attractive for disposable audio applications such as audio guide of  a museum or marketing gift.
VS1000 Audio Book application demonstrates VS1000 device capabilities in   portable bible or audio book application. The system features  excellent  audio quality, high audio compression. The smart indexing with bookmarking is capable to handle thousands of predefined jumps and endless loops.
VS1000 Developer Board is an application development board for VS1000.   It features all necessary hardware for writing and testing new software  for VS1000.
The 1 Megabit SPI RAM / Video Display Controller VS23S010 Datasheet has been updated to version 0.90 and divided into two documents: one for the memory-only featured Narrow SOIC8, and one for the fully-featured version and both available packages (LQFP48 and Narrow SOIC8). 
VLSI Solution's new telephone number has been updated to the VS1000, VS1003, VS1005, VS1011, VS1033d, VS1053, VS1063, VS1103, and VS8053 datasheets, as well as the VS1063 Programmer's and Hardware Guides. 
The new datasheet contains a minor update to the typical connection diagram input voltages. 
The new datasheet clarifies the available audio formats in more detail than before. The new hardware guide clarifies GPIO usage. 
Along with some minor corrections, the new datasheet adds pictures and technical drawings of the new LFGA-88 package.

Wherever you go, you are surrounded by  the sound. From the moment your alarm clock wakes you up, sound follows you everywhere on the Internet radio, car stereo, traffic lights, portable stereo, mobile phone, talking ATM, elevator, TV set, baby monitor, Hi-Fi equipment, toys, and many other devices.  
We at VLSI Solution are part of this development. Our high-quality audio integrated circuit products help you put audio everywhere from toys to High-end Hi-Fi equipment. 
VS1005 is the new flagship audio product of VLSI Solution. It is probably the world's highest integrated  system-on-silicon device for personal music players. See our MP3 player presentation. A Developer Board as well as engineering samples for VS1005 are now available. 
VS23S010  is the world's largest capacity, 1 Mbit, SPI RAM. It is perfect for  microcontroller memory expansion applications, like internet stream  buffering. Samples are available.
VS1063 is an MP3 encoder/decoder IC. It's a pin-compatible replacement for VS1053 with many added features, ranging from a speed shifter and 5-channel equalizer to a whole new full duplex codec mode. See our internet streaming presentation. 
VS1000  is a license free  audio player SoC. It is intended for content sellers  such as audio books, tourist guides, announcement systems and intelligent toys.
VS1053 is a high performance decoder and encoder chip for audio streaming applications such as internet radio. VS1053 has multi-format decoding capability and customization by using our IDE. This makes it attractive for the commodity MP3 player market as well.
VS1003 is a high quality MP3+WMA decoder. It is ideal for small micro SD card based player applications. Additionally audio processing power of the device can be used for DSP applications such as adaptive echo cancellation for Skype speaker phones.
VS1103 is for effect processing such as reverb, echo cancellation, PCM recording, MIDI synthesis and simple pitch shifting. Like VS1003 it offers very simple SD card based player applications but with less cost because VS1103 does not need an MP3 decoder  license.
VS1011 is a very popular MP3 decoder. It is very simple to use as an audio interface of a master processor.
The VSMD001 family is a small, high performance, easy to use  Ogg Vorbis audio player that is controlled from the IO pins, UART, SPI or USB. It  can be used as a "plug-in" audio board in electronic systems or as a  standalone small audio player. The audio content can locate either in the embedded  SPI nor flash or in a micro SD card. 
The VSMD301 family has power and audio pins compatible with VSMD001 family. Features are similar as in VSMD001 family. It lacks USB interface of the other family  but has mono ADC with microphone amplifier for recording or mixing. VSMD301 family uses PCM or ADPCM format for audio content. Simple audio format provides low audio delay and  seamless looping capability.
The VS1053b USB Hi-Fi Player is a multi-format "MP3 player" that uses  the VS1053 as a stand-alone component along with a low-cost High Speed  (480 Mbit/s) USB controller. The device can play .MP3, .OGG, .AAC, .M4A,  .WMA, .WAV, .IMA and .MID files with excellent sound quality. It can either use SD/SDHC cards (over 2 GB supported) or internal FLASH  memory.
The HiFi Recorder Application demonstrates the capabilities of VS1000d  and VS1053b chips for high quality stereo recording from line-in or microphone interface.
VS1003 SD Card Mini Player application is an  extremely simple SD card player. It features mp3 and WMA audio formats,  small size, excellent audio quality. It is likely the  simplest, smallest and lowest cost SD card player in the world.
VS1000 Button Cell Player application is a very low power audio player. It features Ogg Vorbis decoding with  very low bit rates and  credit card size. The low BOM   of less than 3 USD and royalty free audio compression make it attractive for disposable audio applications such as audio guide of  a museum or marketing gift.
VS1000 Audio Book application demonstrates VS1000 device capabilities in   portable bible or audio book application. The system features  excellent  audio quality, high audio compression. The smart indexing with bookmarking is capable to handle thousands of predefined jumps and endless loops.
VS1000 Developer Board is an application development board for VS1000.   It features all necessary hardware for writing and testing new software  for VS1000.
The 1 Megabit SPI RAM / Video Display Controller VS23S010 Datasheet has been updated to version 0.90 and divided into two documents: one for the memory-only featured Narrow SOIC8, and one for the fully-featured version and both available packages (LQFP48 and Narrow SOIC8). 
VLSI Solution's new telephone number has been updated to the VS1000, VS1003, VS1005, VS1011, VS1033d, VS1053, VS1063, VS1103, and VS8053 datasheets, as well as the VS1063 Programmer's and Hardware Guides. 
The new datasheet contains a minor update to the typical connection diagram input voltages. 
The new datasheet clarifies the available audio formats in more detail than before. The new hardware guide clarifies GPIO usage. 
Along with some minor corrections, the new datasheet adds pictures and technical drawings of the new LFGA-88 package.

-=-=-TEXT:   	Design and realization of microelectronic systems using VLSI/ULSI technologies require close collaboration among scientists and engineers in the fields of systems architecture, logic and circuit design, chips and wafer fabrication, packaging, testing, and systems applications. Generation of specifications, design, and verification must be performed at all abstraction levels, including the system, register-transfer, logic, circuit, transistor, and process levels.
  	To address this critical area through a common forum, the IEEE Transactions on VLSI Systems was founded. The editorial board, consisting of international experts, invites original papers which emphasize the novel system integration aspects of microelectronic systems, including interactions among system design and partitioning, logic and memory design, digital and analog circuit design, layout synthesis, CAD tools, chips and wafer fabrication, testing and packaging, and system level qualification. Thus, the coverage of this Transactions focuses on VLSI/ULSI microelectronic system integration.
  	Topics of special interest include, but are not strictly limited to, the following: • System Specification, Design and Partitioning, • System-level Test, • Reliable VLSI/ULSI Systems, • High Performance Computing and Communication Systems, • Wafer Scale Integration and Multichip Modules (MCMs), • High-Speed Interconnects in Microelectronic Systems, • VLSI/ULSI Neural Networks and Their Applications, • Adaptive Computing Systems with FPGA components, • Mixed Analog/Digital Systems, • Cost, Performance Tradeoffs of VLSI/ULSI Systems, • Adaptive Computing Using Reconfigurable Components (FPGAs) 
  				A not-for-profit organization, IEEE is the world's largest professional association for the advancement of technology.

-=-=-TEXT: Ming-Bo Lin, "Introduction to VLSI Systems: A Logic, Circuit, and System Perspective" English | ISBN: 143986859X | 2012 | 915 pages | PDF | 10 MB With the advance of semiconductors and ubiquitous computing, the use of system-on-a-chip (SoC) has become an essential technique to reduce product cost. With this progress and continuous reduction of feature sizes, and the development of very large-scale integration (VLSI) circuits, addressing the harder problems requires fundamental understanding of circuit and layout design issues. Furthermore, engineers can often develop their physical intuition to estimate the behavior of circuits rapidly without relying predominantly on computer-aided design (CAD) tools. Introduction to VLSI Systems: A Logic, Circuit, and System Perspective addresses the need for teaching such a topic in terms of a logic, circuit, and system design perspective.To achieve the above-mentioned goals, this classroom-tested book focuses on:Implementing a digital system as a full-custom integrated circuitSwitch logic design and useful paradigms that may apply to various static and dynamic logic familiesThe fabrication and layout designs of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) VLSIImportant issues of modern CMOS processes, including deep submicron devices, circuit optimization, interconnect modeling and optimization, signal integrity, power integrity, clocking and timing, power dissipation, and electrostatic discharge (ESD)Introduction to VLSI Systems builds an understanding of integrated circuits from the bottom up, paying much attention to logic circuit, layout, and system designs. Armed with these tools, readers can not only comprehensively understand the features and limitations of modern VLSI technologies, but also have enough background to adapt to this ever-changing field.

DASSAI: Innovating Sake Brewing with Massive Usage of Data and IT
                 Date: Thursday June 18, 12:45-14:05
Speaker: Kazuhiro Sakurai, Asahi Shuzo Co., Ltd.
It has been believed that Sake, a Japanese traditional rice wine, can only be brewed by people called TOJI, the Sake specialists experienced for more than several 10s of years. To the contrary, DASSAI, award winning Sake famous for its fruity flavor and smooth taste, does not rely on TOJI at all: It is brewed using a really scientific approach based on data measurement and analytics, during the whole process of brewing (polishing, washing, steaming, fermenting, etc.), as well as for controlling the quality of the ingredients (rice, water and koji). Asahishuzou, the DASSAI brewer, is now encompassing cloud-based rice farming for shipping DASSAI at even better quality with larger quantity. We can learn a lot from their story on their Sake innovation, such as what was a key for making a small business in a small village into world famous one, etc. During this luncheon, you can also taste, a little bit, how good DASSAI really is.

-=-=-TEXT: The VLSI-DAT and the VLSI-TSA symposia are proud to create this annual platform for the latest technical exchanges and communications between experts from all over the world. For example, for the 2014 VLSI-DAT not only three leading thinkers in the industry were invited to deliver the joint plenary keynote speeches (including Dr. Ronald M. Martino of Freescale, Dr. Atul Tambe of IBM, and Dr. David Prutchi of  Impulse Dynamics), but there were also two carefully planned  joint invited sessions on day 1 and day 3 of the conference. Please click the spotlight for more information about the 2014 VLSI-DAT and the VLSI-TSA symposia.
                          The 2015 International Symposium on VLSI Design, Automation and Test (2015 VLSI-DAT) will again be held in the Ambassador Hotel, Hsinchu, Taiwan during April 27-29, 2015. Organized by Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) and technically cooperations with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the 2015 VLSI-DAT provides excellent opportunities for close interactions between industrial and scientific researchers via presentations and discussions on innovations and achievements related to VLSI design, automation and test.
                         In 2015, the VLSI-DAT and the VLSI-TSA will be held again in the same week with three-day overlap. In response to the need of interactions between the technology and design communities, delegates registered for either 2015 VLSI-DAT or 2015 VLSI-TSA will be able to attend the program of both symposia. Original unpublished papers are solicited. Accepted papers will be published by the IEEE and be included in IEEE eXplorer after being presented in the symposium.  
The 2015 VLSI-DAT and VLSI-TSA will feature three joint plenary sessions, two joint invited sessions, along with a luncheon talk. Specifically, the 2015 VLSI-DAT technical sessions including 3 plenary talks, 2 industry sessions, 2 special sessions , 3 parallel tutorials and regular paper presentations. In addition, the Best Paper Award for the 2014 VLSI-DAT Symposium will be presented at the opening of the symposium in 2015, and the Best Paper Award for the 2015 Symposium will again be selected during the conference. More details of the Symposium program will be released in January, 2015.
  Hsinchu City was the "Treading Center" of the near area. It is the first developed city of the north Taiwan. With its Science-based Industrial Park, Hsinchu is famous for its world-class foundries, TSMC and UMC, and many world-leading fabless IC design companies such as MediaTek, Novatek, and Sunplus. It is also characterized by the National Tsing Hua University, National Chiao-Tung University and ITRI, the well-known research institute. Please join us at the 2015 VLSI-DAT to experience vibrant Hsinchu city in which the technical and cultural atmosphere have been harmoniously connected. We will keep updating you with more latest 2015 VLSI-DAT information here.

-=-=-TITLE:  VLSI Basics And Interview Questions
-=-=-SNIPPET:  This Blog is created for Basic VLSI Interview Questions. This content is purely VLSI Basics.
-=-=-TEXT:  In lower technology nodes the gate oxide of the transistor is so thin and sensitive to voltage fluctuations in the power supply. If the gate of the transistor is directly connected to the Power/Ground network (Power Grid Network), the gate oxide of the transistor might be damaged due to voltage fluctuations in the power supply. To overcome this disadvantage, Tie cells are inserted.
  By using blockages and halos, They prevent the tool placing cells in that particular locations to give enough space for routing near the macros. For more details, please refer Blockages halos post.
 Level Shifters are used in multi voltage design in which more than one voltage supply used. Consider In your design two voltage domains are there. One voltage domain V1 has 1.2V power supply another domain V2 has 1V power supply. Signal has to cross from one domain to another domain while in functional mode. Now assume signal crossing from Low voltage domain V2 to High voltage domain V1, It's logic is interpreted wrongly at V1. To prevent this level shifters are inserted between the different voltage domains for the signals which cross from low voltage domain to High voltage domain and from High voltage domain to low voltage domains.
 Power switches are used in power gating technique. As we already discussed in previous post, Power gating is used to reduce the static (Leakage) power in the design. Power gating is performed by shutting down the power for portion of design. Power switches are used to turn off the portions of design which are inactive at a point of time to reduce leakage power.
 Retention Registers are used to store register states before power down mode. These values will be restored when power is up. So retention cells should be always on to serve the purpose. As these are always on, It can consume power even power down mode. 
 You can also click on any metal / via segments to see the amount of current flowing through the geometry. Static analysis shows the average current and dynamic analysis shows peak current. In static analysis, it will also show you the current direction. “CUR” Map shows the current distribution throughout the chip.High transient current can be caused by simultaneous switching in the design.
 In the place_opt command, the -congestion option causes the tool to apply more effort to congestion removal, resulting in better routability. However, this option should be used only if congestion is expected to be a problem because it requires more runtime and causes area utilization to be less uniform across the available placement area. If congestion is found to be a problem after placement and optimization, it can be improved incrementally with the refine_placement command. Timing, area, and congestion optimization can also be done incrementally with the psynopt command.

  Design and realization of microelectronic systems using VLSI/ULSI technologies require close collaboration among scientists and engineers in the fields of systems architecture, logic and circuit design, chips and wafer fabrication, packaging, testing and systems applications. Generation of specifications, design and verification must be performed at all abstraction levels, including the system, register-transfer, logic, circuit, transistor and process levels.   
  To address this critical area through a common forum, the IEEE Transactions on VLSI Systems have been founded. The editorial board, consisting of international experts, invites original papers which emphasize and merit the novel systems integration aspects of microelectronic systems including interactions among systems design and partitioning, logic and memory design, digital and analog circuit design, layout synthesis, CAD tools, chips and wafer fabrication, testing and packaging, and systems level qualification. Thus, the coverage of these Transactions will focus on VLSI/ULSI microelectronic systems integration.

-=-=-TITLE:  VLSI Projects | Final Year IEEE Projects
-=-=-SNIPPET:  VLSI Projects are an excellent alternative for students looking for technically challenging IEEE Projects. We offer 100s of real time projects in VLSI.
-=-=-TEXT: VLSI based projects fall into two broad categories, namely VLSI based system design and VLSI design itself. Though both these terms might look similar there is a very significant difference between the two. VLSI based system design involves using already existing FPGA / CPLDs and their respective development tools to create new systems. VLSI design itself involves design of new ICs for increase in power efficiency or increase in computational capacities etc.
We at Ensemble offer VLSI projects in the system design category, because it has wider scope for innovation and creating new applications. VLSI projects are technically rewarding because they involve the design of a system from the scratch. Also unlike a few years ago when hardware implementations in VLSI projects was prohibitively complicated and expensive, these days that is not much of a challenge.
At Ensemble we work with various FPGA and CPLD architectures from different vendors like Altera and Xilinx. Both of these manufacturers have come up with relatively low cost products that are suitable for applications where cost is a constraint. Using these low cost products student projects can be built and hardware implementations are also possible.
Additionally, the recent additions of soft core processors like Altera’s NIOS II and Xilinx’s Microblaze have opened up new possibilities for projects in VLSI. Using these soft core processors new VLSI projects are possible now without using too much of VHDL or Verilog codes. With these softcore processors real time projects in VLSI can be implemented.
Also with the use of other associated technologies very good hardware projects in VLSI are possible. Another reason why a student might be interested in a VLSI project is because of the future career prospects. Lots of career opportunities are possible in the VLSI domain and hence a project in VLSI makes all the more sense.
VLSI design in general and projects in VLSI in particular are equally applicable for ECE, EEE and even EandI departments. ECE projects in VLSI could be using various communication technologies, be it wired or wireless. Similarly EEE projects in VLSI could be on machine control, power line communication etc. Be it ECE VLSI projects or EEE VLSI projects, real time projects are possible in both cases.
Another reason why VLSI is a good field is the availability of plenty of IEEE base papers for projects in VLSI. Every day new IEEE papers related to VLSI are published and hence a good IEEE project in VLSI is not hard to find. Our project list for the year 2013-14, based on the latest IEEE 2013 papers includes many VLSI IEEE projects as well, from which the students can choose a projects. Alternatively if students have a project idea in VLSI that they want implemented, then we can evaluate the IEEE base paper of the project can let the students know if the same can be implemented.

-=-=-TEXT: Dynamic gates use clock for their normal operation as opposed to the static gates, which don’t use clocks.
Dynamic gates use NMOS or PMOS logic. It doesn’t use CMOS logic like regular static gates. Because it uses either NMOS or PMOS logic and not CMOS logic, it usually has fewer transistors compared to static gates. Although there are extra transistors given that it uses clocks.
Figure : NMOS pull down logic for NOR gate.
The figure shows the pull down NMOS logic for a NOR gate. This pull down structure is used in the dynamic gates.
How dynamic gates work :
In static gates, inputs switch and after a finite input to output delay, output possibly switches to the expected state.
As you can see in the figure above, dynamic gate is made using NMOS pull down logic along with clock transistors on both pull up and pull  down paths.
We know that clock has two phases, the low phase and the high phase. Dynamic gate has two operating phases based on the clock phases. During the low clock phase, because of the pmos gate on the pull up network, the output of dynamic gate is pre-charged to high phase. This is the pre-charge state of dynamic gate.
When the clock is at high phase, the output of dynamic gate may change based on the inputs, or it may stay pre-charged depending on the input. The phase of the dynamic gates, when the clock is high, is called the evaluate phase. As it is essentially evaluating what the output should be during this phase.
Figure : Dynamic NOR waveforms when input ‘A’ is high.
As seen in the waveforms above, as soon as CLK goes low, it pre-charges output node ‘Out’ high. While in the pre-charge state, NOR input ‘A’ goes high. When CLK goes high, and evaluation phase begins, ‘Out’ is discharged to low as input ‘A’ is high. Input ‘B’ is not shown in the waveform as it is not relevant to this case.
If both inputs ‘A’ and ‘B’ were to remain low, output node would be held high during the pre-charge.
This technique of always priming or pre-charging output to be with, is a way to minimize  switching of the output node, because if with a new set of inputs, output was supposed to be high, it wouldn’t have to switch, as it is already pre-charged. Output  only has to switch in the case where it has to be low.
But obviously such reduction in  output  switching doesn’t come free, as it means introducing the clocks and  the extra pre-charge face, where output is not ready to be sampled.
One of the biggest concerns with dynamic gates, is the crowbar current. It needs to be ensured that the clock input to the pull up and pull down is the same node, because of pull up and pull down clocks are coming from different sources, there is a higher likelihood of both pull up and pull down transistors to be on at the same time and hence the crowbar current.
Dynamic gates burn more power because of the associated clocks. Clock signal switches continuously, hence there is more dynamic power dissipated.
CMOS is the short form for the Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor. Complementary stands for the fact that in CMOS technology based logic, we use both p-type devices and n-type devices.
Logic circuits that use only p-type devices is referred to as PMOS logic and similarly circuits only using n-type devices are called NMOS logic. Before CMOS technology became prevalent, NMOS logic was widely used. PMOS logic had also found its use in specific applications.
Lets understand more how NMOS logic works. As per the definition, we are only allowed to use the n – type device as building blocks. No p-type devices are allowed. Lets take an example to clarify this. Following is the truth table for a NOR gate.
We need to come up the a circuit for this NOR gate, using n-mos only transistors. From our understanding  of CMOS logic, we can think about the pull down tree, which is made up of only n-mos gates.
Here we can see that when either of the inputs ‘A’ or ‘B’ is high, the output is pulled down to the ground. But this circuit only reflects the negative logic, or the partial functionality of NOR gate when at least one of the inputs is high. This doesn’t represent the case where both input area low, the first row of the truth table. For an equivalent CMOS NOR gate, there would be pull up tree made up of p-mos devices.
But here we are referring to NMOS logic and we are not allowed to have p-mos devices. How could we come up with the pull up logic for our NOR gate ? The answer is a resistor. Essentially when both n-mos transistor are turned off, we want ‘out’ node to be pulled up and held at VDD. A resistor tied between VDD and ‘out’ node would achieve this. There could be other possible elaborate schemes to achieve the same using n-mos transistors for pulling up purpose, but an n-mos as a resistor is used to pull up the output node.
Of course you see some immediate drawbacks. You can see that when at least one of the pull down n-mos is on, there is a static bias current flowing from VDD to the ground even in the steady state. Which is why such circuits dissipate almost an order of magnitude more power compared to CMOS equivalent. Not only that, this type of circuit is very susceptible to the input noise glitches.
Any n-mos device can be made into a resistor by making it permanently on. N-mos device has inherent resistance and we can achieve the desired resistance by modulating the width of n-mos transistor.
In Verilog certain type of assignments or expression are scheduled for execution at the same time and order of their execution is not guaranteed. This means they could be executed in any order and the order could be change from time to time. This non-determinism is called the race condition in Verilog.
For the purpose of refreshing your memory here is the Verilog execution order again, which we had discussed in a prior post.
Figure : Verilog execution order.
If you look at the active event queue, it has multiple types of statements and commands with equal priority, which means they all are scheduled to be executed together in any random order, which leads to many of the races..
Lets look at some of the common race conditions that one may encounter.
1) Read-Write or Write-Read race condition.
Take the following example :
 x = 2;
 y = x;
Both assignments have same sensitivity ( posedge clk ), which means when clock rises, both will be scheduled to get executed at the same time. Either first ‘x’ could be assigned value ’2′ and then ‘y’ could be assigned ‘x’, in which case ‘y’ would end up with value ’2′. Or it could be other way around, ‘y’ could be assigned value of ‘x’ first, which could be something other than ’2′ and then ‘x’ is assigned value of ’2′. So depending on the order final value of ‘y’ could be different.
How can you avoid this race ? It depends on what your intention is. If you wanted to have a specific order, put both of the statements in that order within a ‘begin’…’end’ block inside a single ‘always’ block. Let’s say you wanted ‘x’ value to be updated first and then ‘y’ you can do following. Remember blocking assignments within a ‘begin’ .. ‘end’ block are executed in the order they appear.
 x = 2;
 y = x;
2) Write-Write race condition.
 x = 2;
 x = 9;
Here again both blocking assignments have same sensitivity, which means they both get scheduled to be executed at the same time in ‘active event’ queue, in any order. Depending on the order you could get final value of ‘x’ to be either ’2′ or ’9′. If you wanted a specific order, you can follow the example in previous race condition.
3) Race condition arising from a ‘fork’…’join’ block.
 x = 2;
 y = x;
Unlike ‘begin’…’end’ block where expressions are executed in the order they appear, expression within ‘fork’…’join’ block are executed in parallel. This parallelism can be the source of the race condition as shown in above example.
Both blocking assignments are scheduled to execute in parallel and depending upon the order of their execution eventual value of ‘y’ could be either ’2′ or the previous value of ‘x’, but it can not be determined beforehand.
4) Race condition because of variable initialization.
In Verilog ‘reg’ type variable can be initialized within the declaration itself. This initialization is executed at time step zero, just like initial block and if you happen to have an initial block that does the assignment to the ‘reg’ variable, you have a race condition.
There are few other situations where race conditions could come up, for example if a function is invoked from more than one active blocks at the same time, the execution order could become non-deterministic.
-SS.
When it comes to doing digital circuit design, one has to know how to size gates. The idea is to pick gate sizes in such a way that it gives the best power v/s performance trade off. We refer to concept of ‘fanout’ when we talk about gate sizes. Fanout for CMOS gates, is the ratio of the load capacitance (the capacitance that it is driving) to the input gate capacitance. As capacitance is proportional to gate size, the fanout turns out to be the ratio of the size of the driven gate to the size of the driver gate.
Fanout of a CMOS gate depends upon the load capacitance and how fast the driving gate can charge and discharge the load capacitance. Digital circuits are mainly about speed and power tradeoff. Simply put, CMOS gate load should be within the range where driving gate can charge or discharge the load within reasonable time with reasonable power dissipation.
Our aim is to find out the nominal fanout value which gives the best speed with least possible power dissipation. To simplify our analysis we can focus on the leakage power, which is proportional to the width or size of the gate. Hence our problem simplifies to, how can we get the smallest delay through gates, while choosing smallest possible gate sizes.
Typical fanout value can be found out using the CMOS gate delay models. Some of the CMOS gate models are very complicated in nature. Luckily there are simplistic delay models, which are fairly accurate. For sake of comprehending this issue, we will go through an overly simplified delay model.
We know that I-V curves of CMOS transistor are not linear and hence, we can’t really assume transistor to be a resistor when transistor is ON, but as mentioned earlier we can assume transistor to be resistor in a simplified model, for our understanding. Following figure shows a NMOS and a PMOS device. Let’s assume that NMOS device is of unit gate width ‘W’ and for such a unit gate width device the resistance is ‘R’. If we were to assume that mobility of electrons is double that of holes, which gives us an approximate P/N ratio of 2/1 to achieve same delay(with very recent process technologies the P/N ratio to get same rise and fall delay is getting close to 1/1). In other words to achieve the same resistance ‘R’ in a PMOS device, we need PMOS device to have double the width compared to NMOS device. That is why to get resistance ‘R’ through PMOS device device it needs to be ‘2W’ wide.
Figure 1. R and C model of CMOS inverter
Our model inverter has NMOS with width ‘W’ and PMOS has width ‘2W’, with equal rise and fall delays. We know that gate capacitance is directly proportional to gate width. Lets also assume that for width ‘W’, the gate capacitance is ‘C’. This means our NMOS gate capacitance is ‘C’ and our PMOS gate capacitance is ‘2C’. Again for sake of simplicity lets assume the diffusion capacitance of transistors to be zero.
Lets assume that an inverter with ‘W’ gate width drives another inverter with gate width that is ‘a’ times the width of the driver transistor. This multiplier ‘a’ is our fanout. For the receiver inverter(load inverter), NMOS gate capacitance would be  a*C as gate capacitance is proportional to the width of the gate.
Figure 2. Unit size inverter driving ‘a’ size inverter
Now let’s represent this back to back inverter in terms of their R and C only models.
Figure 3. Inverter R & C model
For this RC circuit, we can calculate the delay at the driver output node using Elmore delay approximation. If you can recall in Elmore delay model one can find the total delay through multiple nodes in a circuit like this : Start with the first node of interest and keep going downstream along the path where you want to find the delay. Along the path stop at each node and find the total resistance from that node to VDD/VSS and multiply that resistance with total Capacitance on that node. Sum up such R and C product for all nodes.
In our circuit, there is only one node of interest. That is the driver inverter output, or the end of resistance R. In this case total resistance from the node to VDD/VSS is ‘R’ and total capacitance on the node is ‘aC+2aC=3aC’. Hence the delay can be approximated to be ‘R*3aC= 3aRC’
Now to find out the typical value of fanout ‘a’, we can build a circuit with chain of back to back inverters like following circuit.
Figure 4. Chain of inverters.
Objective is to drive load CL with optimum delay through the chain of inverters. Lets assume the input capacitance of first inverter is ‘C’ as shown in figure with unit width. Fanout being ‘a’ next inverter width would ‘a’ and so forth.
The number of inverters along the path can be represented as a function of CL and C like following.
Total delay along the chain D = Total inverters along the chain * Delay of each inverter.
Earlier we learned that for a back to back inverters where driver inverter input gate capacitance is ‘C’ and the fanout ration of ‘a’, the delay through driver inverter is 3aRC
If we want to find the minimum value of total delay function for a specific value of fanout ‘a’, we need to take the derivative of ‘total delay’ with respect to ‘a’ and make it zero. That gives us the minima of the ‘total delay’ with respect to ‘a’.
For this to be true
Which means : ln(a) = 1, the root of which is a = e.
This is how we derive the fanout of ‘e’ to be an optimal fanout for a chain of inverters.
 If one were to plot the value of total delay ‘D’ against ‘a’ for such an inverter chain it looks like following.
Figure 5. Total delay v/s Fanout graph
As you can see in the graph, you get lowest delay through a chain of inverters around ratio of ‘e’. Of course we made simplifying assumptions including the zero diffusion capacitance. In reality graph still follows similar contour even when you improve inverter delay model to be very accurate. What actually happens is that from fanout of 2 to fanout of 6 the delay is within less than 5% range. That is the reason, in practice a fanout of 2 to 6 is used with ideal being close to ‘e’.
One more thing to remember here is that, we assumed a chain of inverter. In practice many times you would find a gate driving a long wire. The theory still applies, one just have to find out the effective wire capacitance that the driving gate sees and use that to come up with the fanout ratio.

It is known that with increase in temperate, the resistivity of a metal wire(conductor) increases. The reason for this phenomenon is that with increase in temperature, thermal vibrations in lattice increase. This gives rise to increased electron scattering. One can visualize this as electrons colliding with each other more and hence contributing less to the streamline flow needed for the flow of electric current.
But in semiconductors, when the supply voltage of a MOS transistor is reduced, and interesting effect is observed. At lower voltages the delay through the MOS device decreases with increasing temperature, rather than increasing. After all common wisdom is that with increasing temperature the mobility decreases and hence one would have expected reduced current and  subsequently reduced delay. This effect is also referred to as low voltage Inverted Temperature Dependence.
 Lets first see, what does the delay of a MOS transistor depend upon, in a simplified model.
 here ‘300’ is room temperature in kelvin.
Mobility and threshold voltage both decreases with temperature. But decrease in mobility means less drain current and slower device, whereas decrease in threshold voltage means increase in drain current and faster device.
This is the reason, at higher voltages device delay increase with temperature but at lower voltages, device delay increases with temperature.
Both synchronous reset and asynchronous reset have advantages and disadvantages and based on their characteristics and the designers needs, one has to choose particular implementation.
Synchronous reset :
Advantages :
- This is the obvious advantage. synchronous reset conforms to synchronous design guidelines hence it ensures your design is 100% synchronous. This may not be a requirement for everyone, but many times it is a requirement that design be 100% synchronous. In such cases, it will be better to go with synchronous reset implementation.
- Protection against spurious glitches. Synchronous reset has to set up to the active clock edge in order to be effective. This provides for protection against accidental glitches as long these glitches don’t happen near the active clock edges. In that sense it is not 100% protection as random glitch could happen near the active clock edge and meet both setup and hold requirements and can cause flops to reset, when they are not expected to be reset.
This type of random glitches are more likely to happen if reset is generated by some internal conditions, which most of the time means reset travels through some combinational logic before it finally gets distributed throughout the system.
Figure : Glitch with synchronous reset
As shown in the figure, x1 and x2 generate (reset)bar. Because of the way x1 and x2 transition during the first clock cycle we get a glitch on reset signal, but because reset is synchronous and because glitch did not happen near the active clock edge, it got filtered and we only saw reset take effect later during the beginning of 4th clock cycle, where it was expected.
- One advantage that is touted for synchronous resets is smaller flops or the area savings. This is really not that much of an advantage. In terms of area savings it is really a wash between synchronous and asynchronous resets.
Synchronous reset flops are smaller as reset is just and-ed outside the flop with data, but you need that extra and gate per flop to accommodate reset. While asynchronous reset flop has to factor reset inside the flop design, where typically one of the last inverters in the feedback loop of the slave device is converted into NAND gate
Figure : Synchronous v/s Asynchronous reset flop comparison.
- Wide enough pulse of the reset signal. We saw that being synchronous, reset has to meet the setup to the clock. We saw earlier in the figure that spurious glitches gets filtered in synchronous design, but this very behavior could be a problem. On the flip side when we do intend the reset to work, the reset pulse has to be wide enough such that it meets setup to the active edge of the clock for the all receivers sequentials on the reset distribution network.
- Another major issue with synchronous is clock gating. Designs are increasingly being clock gated to save power. Clock gating is the technique where clock is passed through an and gate with an enable signal, which can turn off the clock toggling when clock is not used thus saving power. This is in direct conflict with reset. When chip powers up, initially the clocks are not active and they could be gated by the clock enable, but right during the power up we need to force the chip into an known set and we need to use reset to achieve that. Synchronous reset will not take into effect unless there is active edge and if clock enable is off, there is no active edge of the clock.
Designer has to carefully account for this situation and design reset and clock enabling strategy which accounts for proper circuit operation.
- Use of tri-state structures. When tri-state devices are used, they need to be disabled at power-up. Because, when inadvertently enabled, tri-state device could crowbar and excessive current could flow through them and it could damage the chip. If tri-state enable is driven by a synchronous reset flop, the flop output could not be low, until the active edge of the clock arrives, and hence there is a potential to turn on tri-state device.
Asynchronous reset :
- Faster data path. Asynchronous reset scheme removes that AND gate at the input of the flop, thus saving one stage delay along the data path. When you are pushing the timing limits of the chip. This is very helpful.
- It has obvious advantage of being able to reset flops without the need of a clock. Basically assertion of the reset doesn’t have to setup to clock, it can come anytime and reset the flop. This could be double edged sword as we have seen earlier, but if your design permits the use of asynchronous reset, this could be an advantage.
- Biggest issue with asynchronous reset is reset de-assertion edge. Remember that when we refer to reset as ‘asynchronous’, we are referring to only the assertion of reset. You can see in figure about synchronous and asynchronous reset comparison, that one of the way asynchronous reset is implemented is through converting one the feedback loop inverters into NAND gate. You can see that when reset input of the NAND gate, goes low it forces the Q output to be low irrespective of the input of the feedback loop. But as soon as you deassert reset, that NAND gate immediately becomes an inverter and we are back to normal flop, which is susceptible to the setup and hold requirements. Hence de-assertion of the reset could cause flop output to go metastable depending upon the relative timing between de-assertion and the clock edge. This is also called reset recovery time check, which asynchronous reset have to meet even if they are asynchronous ! You don’t have this problem in synchronous reset, as you are explicitly forced to check both setup and hold on reset as well as data, as both are AND-ed and fed to the flop.
- Spurious glitches. With asynchronous reset, unintended glitches will cause circuit to go into reset state. Usually a glitch filter has to be introduced right at the reset input port. Or one may have to switch to synchronous reset.
- If reset is internally generated and is not coming directly from the chip input port, it has to be excluded for DFT purposes. The reason is that, in order for the ATPG test vectors to work correctly, test program has to be able to control all flop inputs, including data, clock and all resets. During the test vector application, we can not have any flop get reset. If reset is coming externally, test program hold it at its inactive value. If master asynchronous reset is coming externally, test program also holds it at inactive state, but if asynchronous reset is generated internally, test program has no control on the final reset output and hence the asynchronous reset net has to be removed for DFT purpose.
One issue that is common to both type of reset is that reset release has to happen within one cycle. If reset release happen in different clock cycles, then different flops will come out of reset in different clock cycles and this will corrupt the state of your circuit. This could very well happen with large reset distribution trees, where by some of receivers are closer to the master distribution point and others could be farther away.
Thus reset tree distribution is non-trivial and almost as important as clock distribution. Although you don’t have to meet skew requirements like clock, but the tree has to guarantee that all its branches are balanced such that the difference between time delay of any two branches is not more than a clock cycle, thus guaranteeing that reset removal will happen within one clock cycle and all flops in the design will come out of reset within one clock cycle, maintaining the coherent state of the design.
To address this problem with asynchronous reset, where it could be more severe, the master asynchronous reset coming off chip, is synchronized using a synchronizer, the synchronizer essentially converts asynchronous reset to be more like synchronous reset and it becomes the master distributor of the reset ( head of reset tree). By clocking this synchronizer with the clock similar to the clock for the flops( last stage clock in clock distribution), we can minimize the risk of reset tree distribution not happening within one clock.

Following three items are essential for getting to the bottom of Verilog execution order.
1) Verilog event queues.
2) Determinism in Verilog.
3) Non determinism in Verilog.
Verilog event queues : 
To get a very good idea of the execution order of different statements and assignments, especially the blocking and non-blocking assignments, one has to have a sound comprehension of inner workings of Verilog.
This is where Verilog event queues come into picture. Sometime it is called stratified event queues of Verilog. It is the standard IEEE spec about system Verilog, as to how different events are organized into logically segmented events queues during Verilogsimulation and in what order they get executed.
 Figure : Stratified Verilog Event Queues.
As per standard the event queue is logically segmented into four different regions. For sake of simplicity we’re showing the three main event queues. The “Inactive” event queue has been omitted as #0 delay events that it deals with is not a recommended guideline.
As you can see at the top there is ‘active’ event queue. According to the IEEE Verilog spec, events can be scheduled to any of the event queues, but events can be removed only from the “active” event queue. As shown in the image, the ‘active’ event queue holds blocking assignments, continuous assignments. primitive IO updates and $write commands. Within “active” queue all events have same priority, which is why they can get executed in any order and is the source of nondeterminism in Verilog.
 There is a separate queue for the LHS update for the nonblocking assignments. As you can see that LHS updates queue is taken up after “active” events have been exhausted, but LHS updates for the nonblocking assignments could re-trigger active events.
Lastly once the looping through the “active” and non blocking LHS update queue has settled down and finished, the “postponed” queue is taken up where $strobe and $monitor commands are executed, again without any particular preference of order.
At the end simulation time is incremented and whole cycle repeats.
Based on the event queue diagram above we can make some obvious conclusions about the determinism.
- $strobe and $monitor commands are executed after all the assignment updates for the current simulation unit time have been done, hence $strobe and $monitor command would show the latest value of the variables at the end of the current simulation time.
- Statements within a begin…end block are evaluated sequentially. This means the statements within the begin…end block are executed in the order they appear within the block. The current block execution could get suspended for execution of other active process blocks, but the execution order of any being..end block does not change in any circumstances.
This is not to be confused with the fact that nonblocking assignment LHS update will always happen after the blocking assignments even if blocking assignment appears later in the begin..end order. Take following example.
initial begin
 x = 0
 y <= 3
 z = 8
 end
When we refer of execution order of these three assignments.
1) First blocking statement is executed along with other blocking statements which are active in other processes.
2) Secondly for the nonblocking statement only RHS is evaluated, it is crucial to understand that the update to variable ‘y’ by value of ’3′ doesn’t happen yet. Remember that nonblocking statement execution happens in two stages, first stage is the evaluation of the RHS and second step is update of LHS. Evaluation of RHS of nonblocking statement has same priority as blocking statement execution in general. Hence in our example here, second step is the evaluation of RHS of nonblocking statement and
3) third step is execution of the last blocking statement ‘z = 8′. The last step here will be the update to ‘y’ for the nonblocking statement. As you can see here the begin .. end block maintains the execution order in so far as the within the same priority events.
4) last step would be the update of the LHS for the nonblocking assignment, where ‘y’ will be assigned value of 3.
- One obvious question that comes to mind, having gone through previous example is that what would be the execution order of the nonblocking LHS udpate !! In the previous example we only had one nonblocking statement. What if we had more than one nonblocking statement within the begin..end block. We will look at two variation of this problem. One where two nonblocking assignments are to two different variable and the two nonblocking assignments to same variable !!
First variation.
initial begin
 x = 0
 y <= 3
 z = 8
 p <= 6
 end
For the above mentioned case, the execution order still follows the order in which statements appear.
1) blocking statement ‘x = 0′ is executed in a single go.
2) RHS of nonblocking assignment ‘y <= 3′ is evaluated and LHS update is scheduled.
3) blocking assignment ‘z = 8′ is executed.
4) RHS of nonblocking assignment ‘p <= 6′ is evaluated and LHS update is scheduled.
5) LHS update from the second nonblocking assignment is carried out.
6) LHS update from the last nonblocking assignment is carried out.
Second variation.
initial begin
x = 0
 y <= 3
 z = 8
 y <= 6
 end
For the above mentioned case, the execution order still follows the order in which statements appear.
1) blocking statement ‘x = 0′ is executed in a single go.
2) RHS of nonblocking assignment ‘y <= 3′ is evaluated and LHS update is scheduled.
3) blocking assignment ‘z = 8′ is executed.
4) RHS of nonblocking assignment ‘y <= 6′ is evaluated and LHS update is scheduled.
5) LHS update from the second nonblocking assignment is carried out, ‘y’ is 3 now.
6) LHS update from the last nonblocking assignment is carried out, ‘y’ is 6 now.
Non-determinism in Verilog.
One has to look at the active event queue in the Verilog event queues figure, to get an idea as to where the non-determinism in Verilog stems from. You can see that within the active event queue, items could be executed in any order. This means that blocking assignments, continuous assignments, primitive output updates, and $display command, all could be executed in any random order across all the active processes.
Non-determinism especially bits when race conditions occur. For example we know that blocking assignments across all the active processes will be carried out in random order. This is dandy as long as blocking assignments are happening to different variables. As soon as one make blocking assignments to same variable from different active processes one will run into issues and one can determine the order of execution. Similarly if two active blocking assignments happen to read from and write to the same variable, you’ve a read write race.
We’ll look at Verilog race conditions and overall good coding guidelines in a separate post.

Some people believe that explicitly preparing for job interview questions and answers is futile. Because when it comes to important matter of job interview, what counts is real knowledge of the field. It is not an academic exam, where text-book preparation might come handy. You just have to know the real deal to survive a job interview. Also it is not only about the technical expertise that gets tested during job interview, but it is also about your overall aptitude, your social skill, your analytical skill and bunch of other things which are at stake.
Agreed, that it is not as simple as preparing few specific technical questions will lend you the job. But author’s perspective is that, one should prepare specific interview questions as a supplement to the real deal. One has to have the fundamental technical knowledge, the technical ability, but it doesn’t hurt to do some targeted preparations for job interview. It is more of a brush up of things, revision of old knowledge, tackling of some well-known technical tricks and more importantly boosting your confidence in the process. There is no harm and it definitely helps a lot to do targeted preparation for interview. Not only one should prepare for technical questions, but there is a most often asked behavioral questions set also available. One would be surprised, how much the preparation really helps.
It really depends on which position you are applying. Chip design involves several different skill and ability area, including RTL design, synthesis, physical design, static timing analysis, verification, DFT and lot more. One has to focus on the narrow field relevant to the position one is interviewing for. Most of the job positions tend to be related to ASIC design or the digital design. There are a few position in the custom design, circuit design, memory design and analog or mixed signal design.
What helps is having CMOS fundamental understanding. More than you might realize. Secondly you need to know more about verilog, as you will be dealing with verilog as long as you are in semiconductor industry. Next would come the static timing analysis. You need to know about timing also as long as you are in semiconductor industry as every chip has to run at certain frequency. Knowing about DFT is very crucial as well, because every chip designed has one or the other form of testability features, because in submicron technology no chip is designed without DFT. Basically focus on verilog, timing and DFT and fundamentals about MOS is what you need to begin with.
After having done the de-facto preparation of VLSI interview questions, you can focus more on the specific niche or the focus area that you are interviewing for, which could be verification, analog design or something else.

此前，Hutcheson認為，作為世界最大的晶片代工廠，臺積電將獲得未來大多數的蘋果晶片業務，其中包括當前iPhone 5s、iPad Air、以及iPad mini Retina上的A7晶片。
Hutcheson表示，「夏季的時候，三星的工廠相當空閒，但是隨後，它們又都突然恢復了」。此外，三星的策略也很有趣，比如聯手美國的GlobalFoundries一起排擠臺積電。
或許，對於臺積電來說，三星的最大優勢仍在於已經同蘋果攜手合作多年，因此更瞭解如何處理兩者之間的關係。
至於Globalfoundries，該公司在紐約北部小鎮Malta有一價值數十億的晶片工廠，並且剛剛獲得了又一筆100億美元的資金注入，因此有充足的空間進行擴張。

  	   Hope you enjoy the session best of luck for future  
Profesor is half of the time of each video stuttering and summing up what was explained in the last video and what will be explained in the next video, so videos seem to be very slow. Besides, I think that the syllabus covers just the very basics and does not go deeper. In my opinion it is too basic even for an introductory course.

  An online archive of documents and artifacts 
 from the Mead-Conway  VLSI design revolution
 Compiled by Lynn Conway

 	Introduction:
 	As we reflect on the past with friends  	and family, we often use photo albums to share our memories – memories that  	bind us together and reveal how we got to where we are. But what about our  	careers? Although the results of our work may linger, mementos of adventures  	along the way are often lost in the rush of events. Only too late do we  	realize what we 'should have saved'.
 	It was different for the VLSI  	revolution in microelectronics; perhaps it was the exciting visual artifacts, or the  	shared-sense of breaking new ground. Whatever the reason, many participants  	saved old treasures from those years (1976-1980) – research notes, prototype  	silicon chips and chip photos,  	even huge color check plots – and stored them away for decades. During  	2008-2010, members of the original VLSI research team, along with colleagues  	in academia and industry, began gathering up, scanning and photographing  	such artifacts – and then posting them online. The resulting 	 	VLSI Archive  	 helps bring  	those exciting days back to life. The online  	 	VLSI Archive Spreadsheet enables easy access to its wide array of  	contents, and its mass of primary historical evidence also provided a great  	starting-point for 	 	writing a memoir about the work.

 Carver A. Mead                             Lynn Conway
 	"By the mid-1970s, digital system designers eager to create  	higher-performance devices were frustrated by having to use off-the-shelf  	large-scale-integration logic. It stymied their efforts to make chips  	sufficiently compact or cost-effective to turn their very large-scale  	visions into timely realities. In 1978, a landmark book titled  	Introduction to VLSI Systems changed all of that. Co-authored by Mead,  	the Gordon and Betty E. Moore professor of computer science and electrical  	engineering at the California Institute of Technology, and Conway, research  	fellow and manager of the VLSI system design area at the Xerox Palo Alto  	Research Center, the book provided the structure for a new integrated system  	design culture that made VLSI design both feasible and practical.  	Introduction to VLSI Systems resulted from work done by Mead and Conway  	while they were part of the Silicon Structures Project, a cooperative effort  	between Xerox and Caltech. Mead was known for his ideas on simplified  	custom-circuit design, which most semiconductor manufacturers viewed with  	great skepticism but were finding increasing support from computer and  	systems firms interested in affordable, high-performance devices tailored to  	their needs. Conway had established herself at IBM’s research headquarters  	as an innovator in the design of architectures for ultrahigh-performance  	computers. She invented scalable VLSI design rules for silicon that  	triggered Mead and Conway’s success in simplifying the interface between the  	design and fabrication of complex chips. The structured VLSI design  	methodology that they presented, the “Mead-Conway concept,” helped bring  	about a fundamental reassessment of how to put ICs together." - 	 	Citation f rom  	the induction of Mead and Conway into the Electronic Design Hall of Fame, in  	2002.  
 Overview:
This page provides links into Lynn Conway's online internet archive of  	documents from the Mead-Conway VLSI chip-design revolution of the late '70's  	and early '80's. Many of the original working papers and key documents have  	been scanned and posted as PDF files in the archive, and are accessible via  	the links from this page.
 	Further more-detailed links to this information are contained in (i) a page  	of 	 	main links to key documents, (ii) a page of 	 	links re the impact of the Mead-Conway work and (iii) a 	 	spreadsheet of links into all the detailed book chapters, document  	sections and photos in the archive. 
 	Included in the archive is the series of '77-'78 drafts of the text  	 	Introduction to VLSI Systems by Mead and Conway. These  	self-published drafts were used to document and test their evolving design  	methods prior to the formal publication of the textbook in late '79. Also  	included are the plan and lecture notes for the pioneering VLSI design  	course Lynn Conway taught at M.I.T. in 1978. Lynn compiled all that  	information into a "Guide  	for the Instructor of VLSI Design", enabling rapid propagation of her  	course in subsequent years. The archive also includes both the 	 	1st and 	 	2nd Editions of the "Guide  	to LSI Implementation", edited by Hon and Sequin, containing critical  	knowledge regarding fast-turnaround chip implementation developed by the  	Mead-Conway teams at Xerox PARC and Caltech. 
 	The Mead-Conway text and the two guidebooks were used to launch VLSI design  	courses at 12 universities in the fall of 1979. In advance of the courses,  	Lynn and her team at PARC innovated and implemented a new type of  	internet-based "VLSI implementation system" to support rapid-prototyping of  	large numbers of chip design projects. In a major internet-happening called  	"MPC79",  	the "MPC System" was deployed to support rapid prototyping of design  	projects from all 12 courses that fall. The archive includes many 	 	documents, data sheets and chip photos from MPC79, all of which are  	accessible via 	 	VLSI Archive Spreadsheet. 
 	The 	 	success of MPC79 and the subsequent 	 	MCP580 set the stage for the 	 	rapid spread of the Mead-Conway methods into over 100 universities within a  	few short years. It also led to DARPA sponsorship of VLSI research in  	the universities to follow-up on the Mead-Conway innovations and to DARPA  	support of rapid-chip-prototyping via a new national-level service called "MOSIS"  	(directly based on the MPC system technology   	Lynn pioneered at PARC). For an overview of  	the development of the Mead-Conway methods and their rapid spread in the  	university and entrepreneurial communities, see "The  	MPC Adventures", by Lynn Conway. See also Lynn's "VLSI  	Reminiscences" for insights into the context of the time, the  	motivations for the Mead-Conway work, how it all got started and how it  	unfolded.  
  Table of links:  
 	Note: See the  VLSI Archive Spreadsheet  for links to  	specific individual documents, pre-publication book chapters, all the MIT78  	and MPC79 chip-photos, etc. For more details on the unfolding of events, see  	the VLSI  		Archive Main Links.
In May 2008, Lynn met with  archivists at the  Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA to begin the process of  archiving documents, photographs and artifacts from the Mead-Conway VLSI design  revolution at the Museum. This will be an ongoing process as further items are  discovered.
Hardcopies of many key  original documents have already been archived at the museum. We'll post a  spreadsheet sometime soon that identifies which items have been placed there.

-=-=-TITLE:  VLSI Engineering Course Schedule | UCSC Extension Silicon Valley
-=-=-SNIPPET:  Introduction to VLSI Systems Carver Mead, Lynn Conway] on Amazon.com. *nFREE* shipping on qualifying offers. Introduction to VLSI Systems. Carver Mead.
-=-=-TEXT: Format: Hardcover      
   This reference continues the construction of actual integrated circuits introduced in the Feynman reference listed above. Theory behind various parts of a stored program (ie, von Neumann) computer, and its fabrication through VLSI techniques is clearly presented. As well, there are chapters on  concurrent computation, for example arrays of processors to perform matrix computations, and the physics of computation. Connecting numerous components together is an important issue in biological computing architectures, and while the latter is not covered, this reference provides valuable insights with regards to the former.  This reference was a classic on the subject in 1980, and its concepts still largely remain valid. 
Format: Hardcover      
   Mead and Conway's book is still quite germane. For those of you new to VLSI, this book is one of the key texts in the field. In 1980, the authors managed to abstract the common steps in chip fabrication. In such a way that chip design could now be taught at the undergraduate level, using this book. Plus accompanying layout software. And the student's design could then be taped out and sent to a fab and actually made.
This was a huge breakthrough. Prior to this book, if you wanted to actually make a chip, using a reasonably current fab, then you could not, as a university student. You had to work for a semiconductor company that had a fab. A large gap in your education. It also meant that a lot of chip knowledge was not transferable if you changed companies.
In software terms, this book is a refactoring. Though this term itself did not come into use for software till the 90s. The book can still be profitably read. Its layout ideas have not become obsolete. In fact, if you were to compare this book with more current undergrad VLSI texts, there is little conceptually new introduced in the latter.

Used this book in Stanford U Summer Institute VLSI course taught by UW Computer Science Professor Dr. Ted Kehl. ".. Mead presented his vision of the "tall, thin man," one who becomes accomplished in all aspects of chip design, from algorithm creation to layout, from concept to chip. Within weeks, faculty, students and engineers alike were showing off their then-state-of-the-art 6m nMOS ..."

   Not the Bible, but certainly the old testament of VLSI and fpga design.
Math intensive. Carver Mead is the Man.

-=-=-TEXT: This VLSI-RN course trains you on the advanced Design and Verification technologies and methodologies. One can easily enter into the VLSI industry with the skill sets that are gained through this training course.
We have created this course completely based on the current job opportunities in the semiconductor industry.  Based on the discussion with the executives of various leading semiconductor industries and FPGA design houses, here are some of the highlights.
In India, 80 to 90% of the projects are on ASIC verification, Synthesis and Back-end
Only 10% of the projects demand skills in RTL Design, AMS and custom design.
Front-end design and verification jobs require candidates with good knowledge in design fundamentals and exposure to the latest verification technologies and methodologies.
Verification process is not completely automated. 70% of the project cycle time is consumed by verification and most of the ASIC re-spins are due to the functional bugs.
Semiconductor industry prefers innovative and young engineers for the verification jobs.
Back-end design implementations are almost automated with the help of EDA tools.

-=-=-SNIPPET:  Maven Silicon is the best VLSI training institute in India which offers various VLSI courses like Job oriented VLSI Design and Verification course, ASIC verification ...
-=-=-TEXT: " Saying thank you is really too short to express how thankful I'm for all the support you provided me with. First of all, the quality of the training is exceptional. It's been a week here for me at Truechip solutions, they've put me in a training session and everything seems like a cakewalk to me after the training I went through at Maven Silicon. I'm being confident and Maven Silicon being the biggest reason behind it. 
 Just a year ago I had less hopes of making it into a VLSI company and now i'm working with people who are graduated from institutes like IITs. A right guidance was all I needed which I found at Maven Silicon.  "
" जब मैंने अपना इंजीनियरिंग कतम किया  था, बहुत सारे fresher के जैसे मुझे भी पता नहीं था कि, Electronics में अपना career कैसे बनूँ.......लेकिन MAVEN SILICON में  मुझे सही रास्ता मिला.
 I got trained in VLSI-RN. उनका course बहुत ही अहसान  और planning भी बहुत  आचे से क्या गया हैं , especially 70% practicals एंड 30 % theory . Maven Silicon का projects भी बहुत useful था. मैं  यकीन के साथ कह सकता हूँ कि, Maven Silicon   VLSI Technology बहुत कम समय में और अची तरा से सिखा देते हैं. में शुक्रगुजार हूँ कि  I chose Maven Silicon . उनका placement opportunities are very excellent . 
Thanks to Mr.Sivakumar (CEO, MAVEN SILICON ) I got placed in Qthink India Design Center, Bangalore"
"The Verification course at Maven Silicon was exactly what I needed while preparing for interviews for ASIC Verification positions. 
The letures and the course material helped me to learn the concepts well, while the challenging project work offered invaluable hands-on technical experience, which eventually helped me to find a job as a Verification Engineer in the industry. I am really glad I found Maven and took up their Verification course."
"I can say this confidently: "Never in my life I have come across such teaching!" The beauty of teaching is in the breaking down of complex concepts to the simplest forms and integrating from there on. I found this beauty being utilized to the maximum extent at Maven Silicon. I came in as a pauper of knowledge and left after my course as a knowledge rich man!
Message to Engineers/Engineering Students: "If you want to merely get a certificate of that of a VLSI Engineer, you can go to any institute you want. But if you want to feel satisfied and inspired by what you learn, come down to Maven Silicon. You'll always thank yourself for having taken such a prudent decision as I do now!"
"I had one of the best learning experiences at Maven Silicon. It has really given me a new insight and energy to kick start a great career.                                  What really has taken Maven to the heights is their dedication and commitment to impart quality education. The Programme content and the training methodology rules. I could not even imagine as to how they make time for the individual attention, but they do it. 
The trainers are highly motivating and they are always there when you look back for help. If you are interested in electronics and think you are capable of doing big things in life, I recommend 'Maven Silicon'.  I am very proud to have been a part of Maven and I will continue to be...!"

-=-=-TEXT: Very-large-scale integration (VLSI) is the process of creating integrated circuits by combining thousands of transistor-based circuits into a single chip. VLSI began in the 1970s when complex semiconductor and communication technologies were being developed.
The first semiconductor chips held one transistor each. Subsequent advances added more and more transistors, and as a consequence more individual functions or systems were integrated over time. The microprocessor is a VLSI device.
The first "generation" of computers relied on vacuum tubes. Then came discrete semiconductor devices, followed by integrated circuits. The first Small-Scale Integration (SSI) ICs had small numbers of devices on a single chip - diodes, transistors, resistors and capacitors (no inductors though), making it possible to fabricate one or more logic gates on a single device. The fourth generation consisted of Large-Scale Integration (LSI), i.e. systems with at least a thousand logic gates. The natural successor to LSI was VLSI (many tens of thousands of gates on a single chip). Current technology has moved far past this mark and today's microprocessors have many millions of gates and hundreds of millions of individual transistors.

-=-=-TEXT: Moore’s Law to keep on 28nm 
By Zvi Or-Bach, President and CEO of MonolithIC 3D Inc. 
Scaling is now bifurcating – some scaling on with 28/22nm, while other push below 14nm. 
In his famous 1965 paper Cramming more components onto integrated circuits , Moore wrote: “The complexity for minimum component costs has increased at a rate of roughly a factor of two per year”. Dimensional scaling below 28nm will only increase the ‘component cost’ as we described in Moore’s Law has stopped at 28nm and is detailed in the following tables published recently by IBS. 

While there is still a strong effort behind dimensional scaling to 14, 10 and 7nm – and possibly even beyond, a new scaling effort is emerging to reduce the ‘component costs’ and increase integration yet still utilize the 28 nm process node. The semiconductor industry is now going through a bifurcation phase. 
This new emerging trend of scaling by factors other than dimensional scaling was recognized early-on by Gordon Moore and was detailed in his 1975 famous IEDM paper “Progress in digital integrated electronics.” . In that paper Moore updated the time scaling rate to every two years and suggested the following factors are helping to drive scaling forward: ”Die size”–“larger chip area” “Dimension”–“higher density” and “finer geometries” “Device and circuit cleverness” 
A fourth factor should have been added to the list above – improvement in manufacturing efficiency, which ensued from the increase in wafer sizes from 4” to 5” and all the way to the 12” of today, and many other manufacturing improvements. 
In the past, all of these factors were aggregated into dimensional scaling as old fabs got obsolete and improvements were implemented predominantly in the new emerging node. Nowadays, as dimensional scaling has reached its diminishing returns phase, we can see a very diverse adaption of technology improvments. 
In his keynote presentation at the 2014 Synopsys user group meeting, Art De Geus, Synopsys CEO, presented multiple slides to illustrate the value of Synopsys’ newer tools to improve older node design effectiveness. The following is one of them: 
AMD’s recent presentation at ISSCC 2015 clearly illustrates this point by showing device improvements while still staying at the same 28 nm process node, see slide below. As could be seen, major improvements in power, yield, and performance are possible over time without changing the technology node. AMD’s President & CEO Dr. Lisa Su presentation in 2015 Semicon China, reiterated AMD’s technology progress within the same 28nm technology node: 
Even more significant would be the adoption of a breakthrough technology. A good example is the SRAM technology developed by Zeno Semiconductor, which has recently been validated on a 28nm process. This new SRAM technology replaces the 6T SRAM bit cell with 1T SRAM (true SRAM – no refresh is needed) providing significant reduction of ‘component costs’ as is illustrated in the following two slides. 
This new industry trend was nicely articulated by Kelvin Low of Samsung covered in “ Samsung Describes Road to 14nm, FinFETs a challenge, FD-SOI an alternative .” Quoting: “Samsung spent several years developing its 14nm technology and debating which process node it would invest in after 28nm. Low expects that 28nm will still be a popular process node for years to come because of its price …The cost per transistor has increased in 14nm FinFETs and will continue to do so, Low said, so an alternative technology such as 28nm SOI is necessary”. TSMC too is now spending on new R&D efforts to improve their 28 nm as was presented in TSMC 2015 Technology Symposium, introducing new 28nm processes, 28HPC+ and 28ULP. 28HPC+ is for high performance, a speed gain of about 15% for the same leakage, or a reduction of 30-50% in leakage for the same speed. The 28ULP (for ultra-low power) process is for IoT applications with a lower operating voltage of 0.7V (versus 0.9V for 28HPC+). And also new standard cell libraries were developed for this process with 9 and 7 track libraries (compared to 12T/9T before). 
“Device and circuit cleverness” as a factor will never stop; however, it is made of a series of individual improvements that will not be enough to sustain a long-term scaling path for the industry. An alternative long-term path will be “Die size” – “larger chip area,” which is effectively monolithic 3D, and manufacturing efficiency, which will have an important role in monolithic 3D. 
And who is better to call it than Mark Bohr of Intel? In a recent blog piece “ Intel predicts Moore’s Law to last another 10 years ” Bohr is quoted predicting “that Moore’s Law will not come to an abrupt halt, but will morph and evolve and go in a different direction, such as scaling density by the 3D stacking of components rather than continuing to reduce transistor size.” 
And this is also visible in the marketplace by the industry-wide adoption of 3D NAND devices that Samsung started to mass-produce in 2014, and followed with a second generation 32 layer-stack device this year, and forecasting going to ~ 100 layers, as illustrated in their slide: 

In the recent webcast “ Monolithic 3D: The Most Effective Path for Future IC Scaling ,” Dr. Maud Vinet of CEA Leti presented their “CoolCube” monolithic 3D technology, which was followed by our own, i.e., MonolithIC 3D, presentation. An important breakthrough presented by us was a monolithic 3D process flow that does not require changes in transistor-formation process and could be easily integrated by any fab at any process node. 
Finally, I’d like to quote Mark Bohr again as we reported in our blog “ Intel Calls for 3D IC ”: “heterogeneous integration enabled by 3D IC is an increasingly important part of scaling” as was presented in ISSCC 2015. 

This is illustrated nicely by the following figure presented by Qualcomm in their ISPD ‘15 paper titled “3D VLSI: A Scalable Integration Beyond 2D.” 

In summary, the general promise of Moore’s Law is not going to end any time soon. Yet it is not going to be the simple brute-force x0.7 dimensional scaling that dominated the industry for the last 5 decades. Quoting Mark Bohr again, it “will morph and evolve and go in a different direction, such as scaling density by the 3D stacking of components rather than continuing to reduce transistor size.” 
P.S. - 
A good conference to learn about these new scaling technologies is the IEEE S3S ‘15 , in Sonoma, CA, on October 5th thru 8th, 2015. CEA Leti is scheduled to give an update on their CoolCube program and three leading researchers from Berkeley, Stanford and Taiwan’s NLA Lab will present their work on advanced monolithic 3D integration technologies.

  The subject of VLSI systems spans a broad range of disciplines, including semiconductor devices and processing, integrated electronic circuits, digital logic, design disciplines and tools for creating complex systems, and the architecture, algorithms, and applications of complete VLSI systems. The Addison-Wesley VLSI Systems Series is being organized as a set of textbooks and research references that present the best current work across this exciting and diverse field, with each book providing for its subject a perspective that ties it to related disciplines. 
 Computer Aids for VLSI Design by Steven Rubin presents a broad and coherent view of the computational tools available to the VLSI designer. This book contains insights and information that will be valuable both to chip designers and to tool builders. Modern VLSI computer aided design (CAD) systems allow the chip designer to access in a consistent and convenient way a variety of synthesis and analysis tools. Such tools have advanced considerably in the past several years, both in their scope and in their ability to handle large designs. 
 Part of what distinguishes the expert chip designer from the novice is an understanding the entire suite of tools that are available, and how they work together to support the design flow of a project. One can come to understand the capabilities and limitations of individual tools in some cases from their external interfaces and roles in the design process. In other cases it is useful to appreciate how the tools work internally. Rubin presents both perspectives for all of the important categories of synthesis and analysis tools. The exposition is readily understandable to anyone familiar with chip design and computer programming. 
 The starting point for this book was a design system called "Electric," which Rubin designed and programmed almost single-handedly over the past four years. Electric is a complete and elegant system that has been used for the design and verification of many chips. The book is not a "manual" for using Electric. Rather, Electric is used as a vehicle for exposing design choices and internal interfaces that are common to many of the advanced design systems currently available. Thus this book allows one to learn in a realistic setting something of the art practiced by VLSI design system developers. 
 Ann Arbor, Michigan 
  This book describes how computers can be programmed to help in the design of very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits. Such circuits are becoming increasingly common due to their ease of manufacture, low cost, and simplified design methodologies. No longer must the designer study electronics and physics to build an integrated circuit. Digital electronic design is taught widely and is accessible to people with any scientific background. 
 As the complexity of these electronic circuits increases, the need to use computers for their design becomes more important. Although computer-aided design (CAD) systems have existed for quite some time, many of them are inadequate for current tasks, and a continuous flow of new tools is being developed. These tools perform more and more of the detailed and repetitive work involved in VLSI system design, thus reducing the time it takes to produce a chip. 
 The need for better VLSI design systems has fostered a need to study these systems more carefully. The book, Introduction to VLSI Systems by Mead and Conway, opened up this field of study to a wider audience than ever before. A follow-on book, Principles of CMOS VLSI Design by Weste and Eshraghian, combined with the first text to present a broad foundation for the construction of VLSI circuits. This book continues where the others have left off: it explores the computer-aided design systems that enable such construction. 
 Although students of this textbook need not have done so, they are advised to have studied one of the mentioned VLSI books and to have done some chip design. This will provide the proper background to distinguish VLSI design from more traditional circuit layout. Students should also be familiar with basic computer-programming issues. The reader of this text is therefore presumed to be a VLSI designer who would like to develop better design tools. In addition to descriptions of techniques, much reference information is provided in this book. 
 Another potential reader of this book is the VLSI designer who, although not interested in programming new tools, would like to develop a finer understanding of the tools that are already in use. This book illustrates the operation and interrelation of the parts of VLSI design systems. Designers who understand these concepts will be better able to work with their systems and to help specify future CAD directions. 
 Also, a person who has never designed chips can still benefit from this book. The subject matter is large system design, which includes many considerations that are independent of electronics. However, many examples do refer to transistors or logic gates as they appear in a circuit. If the reader is not familiar with these notions, then he or she is likely to find the discussions confusing. The reader needs to understand these concepts only abstractly, however; the book does not rely on circuit analysis or electrical-engineering concepts. 
 This book is geared for advanced undergraduate or graduate students. In a course taught to designers and tool builders at Schlumberger, the book was covered with one lecture per chapter. Although some chapters could easily stretch into two lectures, the pace was not too fast. The course provided a good exposition of CAD for VLSI systems. Questions at the end of each chapter range from simple exercises to unsolved problems that can be used as discussion points. 
 Previous texts on CAD systems have focused on specific aspects of the design problem, such as synthesis algorithms or hardware-description languages. This book takes a much broader view. It starts with basics, such as design environments and machine representations; covers the fundamental subjects of synthesis and analysis tools; and also discusses important peripheral notions such as output formats, programmability, graphics, and human engineering. 
 The last chapter of the book ties together the lessons by describing a working VLSI design system called "Electric." This is an instructive example because it embodies many of the features described in the text and because the source code is available to universities for experimentation. Interested schools can contact the author of this book to obtain the system. A more extensive version of Electric, called "Bravo3 VLSI," is sold commercially by Applicon, a Schlumberger company. 
 Like any reference book, this one is certain to be inaccurate. Readers are cautioned against blindly accepting details, and should test all techniques thoroughly. The only way to ensure that an algorithm is correct is to test it in a system.  
  It has been a decade since this book first appeared in print, and much has happened in the world of electronic CAD. Although some of the details in the first edition are no longer correct, all of the basic concepts still apply. For example, the last ten years have seen the creation of the terms ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) and FPGA (field-programmable gate-array). Although these terms did not appear in the first edition, the concepts they embody are not new, and therefore are covered in the book. 
 In creating this second edition, I have corrected those details that are wrong, but left the bulk of the book untouched. Thus, readers of this edition will find corrections to the CIF Appendix, the Electric internals, and many small but useful details. However, I have had neither the time nor the inclination to radically alter the book. So, if you are looking for new chapters on concepts that did not exist before (such as technology mapping), then you will have to look elsewhere. 
 As a sign of the times, this edition of the book appears electronically, rather than on paper. The entire volume is here, and is freely available. Although I ask no compensation for the book's use, you must retain the copyright information on all parts that you use.  
  Thanks are due to a number of people who helped me with this book. The series editors, Lynn Conway and Chuck Seitz, provided good feedback on early drafts of the manuscript, as did the reviewers Bryan Ackland, AT&T Bell Laboratories; John Hayes, University of Michigan; Richard F. Lyon, Schlumberger Palo Alto Research; Neil Weste, Symbolics, Inc.; and Telle Whitney, Schlumberger Palo Alto Research. Thanks are also due to the two guest authors: Bob Hon and Sundar Iyengar. The Fairchild librarians tirelessly helped with numerous references. Finally, a broad note of appreciation goes to the employees of Schlumberger who attended the initial course and waded through the first draft. 
 On a personal level, I am indebted to my wife, Amy Lansky, and my family who have been supportive during this ordeal. Amy provided perspective by reminding me how similar the process of writing a book is to being in graduate school and struggling with a dissertation. I would also like to thank the punk-rock band, S.D. 
  This edition of the book would not exist if it weren't for the efforts of Brian Gardiner, who took my CAD system, Electric, and created a company to sell it. 
 On a personal level, I remain indebted to my wife, Amy Lansky, and my family, which now numbers two children: Izaak and Max. And, of course, I would like to thank the rock&roll band, Severe Tire Damage.

-=-=-TEXT: IEEE 802 refers to a family of IEEE standards dealing with local area networks and metropolitan area networks.  
More specifically, the IEEE 802 standards are restricted to networks carrying variable-size packets. By contrast, in cell relay networks data is transmitted in short, uniformly sized units called cells. Isochronous networks, where data is transmitted as a steady stream of octets, or groups of octets, at regular time intervals, are also out of the scope of this standard. The number 802 was simply the next free number IEEE could assign, though “802” is sometimes associated with the date the first meeting was held — February 1980.  
The services and protocols specified in IEEE 802 map to the lower two layers (Data Link and Physical) of the seven-layer OSI networking reference model. In fact, IEEE 802 splits the OSI Data Link Layer into two sub-layers named Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC), so that the layers can be listed like this:  
Data link layer
LLC Sublayer
MAC Sublayer
Physical layer
The IEEE 802 family of standards is maintained by the IEEE 802 LAN/MAN Standards Committee (LMSC). The most widely used standards are for the Ethernet family, Token Ring, Wireless LAN, Bridging and Virtual Bridged LANs. An individual Working Group provides the focus for each area. 
IEEE developed a set of 802 network standards. They include: 
IEEE 802.1: Standards related to network management.
IEEE 802.2: General standard for the data link layer in the OSI Reference Model. The IEEE divides this layer into two sub-layers -- the logical link control (LLC) layer and the media access control (MAC) layer. The MAC layer varies for different network types and is defined by standards IEEE 802.3 through IEEE 802.5.
IEEE 802.3: Defines the MAC layer for bus networks that use CSMA/CD. This is the basis of the Ethernet standard.
IEEE 802.4: Defines the MAC layer for bus networks that use a token-passing mechanism (token bus networks).
IEEE 802.5: Defines the MAC layer for token-ring networks.
IEEE 802.6: Standard for Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).

   This reference continues the construction of actual integrated circuits introduced in the Feynman reference listed above. Theory behind various parts of a stored program (ie, von Neumann) computer, and its fabrication through VLSI techniques is clearly presented. As well, there are chapters on  concurrent computation, for example arrays of processors to perform matrix computations, and the physics of computation. Connecting numerous components together is an important issue in biological computing architectures, and while the latter is not covered, this reference provides valuable insights with regards to the former.  This reference was a classic on the subject in 1980, and its concepts still largely remain valid. 
Format: Hardcover      
   Mead and Conway's book is still quite germane. For those of you new to VLSI, this book is one of the key texts in the field. In 1980, the authors managed to abstract the common steps in chip fabrication. In such a way that chip design could now be taught at the undergraduate level, using this book. Plus accompanying layout software. And the student's design could then be taped out and sent to a fab and actually made.
This was a huge breakthrough. Prior to this book, if you wanted to actually make a chip, using a reasonably current fab, then you could not, as a university student. You had to work for a semiconductor company that had a fab. A large gap in your education. It also meant that a lot of chip knowledge was not transferable if you changed companies.
In software terms, this book is a refactoring. Though this term itself did not come into use for software till the 90s. The book can still be profitably read. Its layout ideas have not become obsolete. In fact, if you were to compare this book with more current undergrad VLSI texts, there is little conceptually new introduced in the latter.

-=-=-TITLE: An interesting SHTF discussion over breakfast at the cafe - Homesteading Today
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: We were talking this morning about some of the bunker grade preppers some of us know about as we enjoyed our blue plate specials and round table conversation.
One of the guys was talking about a doomsday prepper he knows who has a collection of some decades old discrete electronic components and laughed about him suggesting that he figured the guy must be planning on trying to build a cathedral style radio to pull in the Grand Old Opry after Teowawki.
As I was finishing off my coffee, I told him that the guy may not be that far off base if a massive EMF Teowawki event were to occur taking into consideration that EMF is massive electrical radiation overload and discrete electronics applications are still utilized in many radiation/EMI critical environments.
When I asked him how many folks now did he think would actually be able to build a simple two transistor transmitter or mag wire coil or crystal based receiver, he gave me a deer in the headlights look.
When I reminded him that amateur radio licensing doesn't even require CW code keying anymore, all he could say was "nobody uses morse code and CW anymore".
When I told him even in small scale disasters like Hurricane Sandy folks main concerns comm wise were how to charge their cellphones and tablets but in an EMP scenario where all the new VLSI based gear was blown that his buddy in the bunker might be able to actually tap out some contact to those over the next hill, he just "harumff'd" me.
Our conversation then progressed on to how the Manhattan Project perfected the A bomb and later the physicists developed the H bomb and society accepted the specter of a scorched earth nuclear windblown terrain as technology advanced and miniaturized to such an exponential level that all it will take is a good strong EMP to knock out the advanced electronics while barely making the hair on peoples necks stand up and then let them go zombie as they are starved of the VLSI devices they have become comfortable with.
So many when they think of prepping tend to consider along food and farming aspects but at the same time don't consider the primitive electronic aspects that now go back about a century as possibilities to consider if the TEOWAWKI does occur as a real estate sparing EMP followed by the technozombies turning on each other regardless if manmade or a weird happening of nature that suddenly clears our atmosphere of all the EMI that we float in everyday.
One of our breakfast crew asked me what I would do if such were to happen. All I could tell him was probably check my weapons, see if my old Ford Galaxie 500 with points and generator would crank and hook up my old foxhole radio I built as a grade school science project to my fence to see if I could hear any news before maybe building my own simple discrete transmitter.
I am not nor ever have been a bunker in prepper but now as I have gotten older I accept that I am a hunker down prepper with maybe only one bug out to my next deeper hunker down location if I feel up to it and don't give into my arthritis and Sioux heritage and decide that that day if it comes during my lifetime is "a good day to die".
That is the nice part of prepping and growing old gracefully and in a realistic fashion. Your options actually tend to increase as you strip the blind fear factors often lacking direction away and replace them with more purely logical ones.

-=-=-TITLE: AMD晶片製造公司向台積電宣戰 - 資訊科技界 IT - 大眾論壇 HK-PUB Forum - 港澳台人氣討論區
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: 自超微公司（AMD）獨立分出的Globalfoundries，將在本週五（24日）以盛大的破土儀式，向全球最大的晶片製造商對手宣戰。
前身為AMD晶片製造單位的Globalfoundries，耗資42億美元於紐約州Malta興建的晶圓廠，將於24日破土動工。這是Globalfoundries擠身全球一流晶片製造商的關鍵。該公司的公關經理Jon Carvill表示，未來30天內將公佈一個以上的大客戶名單。
初期顧客可能包括為消費者電器市場設計低功率和無線晶片的公司，他說：「在那個領域擔任重要的角色，有很大的利益。」
Globalfoundries也把眼光放在大型繪圖晶片商，包括全球最大的繪圖晶片商Nvidia。Nvidia執行長黃仁勳曾公開表示，他正在「認真地評估和討論」以Globalfoundries為該公司簽約之晶圓代工廠的可能性。
另一個手到擒來的顧客是AMD的繪圖晶片單位，ATI Technologies。Carvill說Globalfoundries「沒有為AMD大量製造繪圖處理器…還沒有。」此話可能暗示未來將大量生產。
Globalfoundries將在28奈米製程層級積極爭取繪圖晶片生意，因此還有幾年的時間。目前Nvidia和ATI大多數的先進繪圖晶片，仍採用40奈米製程。晶片愈小，速度與效能通常愈高。
毫無意外，Nvidia與ATI目前都選擇全球最大的晶圓代工商台積電（TSMC），這兩家公司也都是Globalfoundries 亟欲從台積電搶走的菁英客戶。繪圖晶片商經常是最先採用新製程的公司，因為他們需要盡可能在單一晶片裝入更多電晶體（目前最高可達10億），才能保持效能競爭力。
Globalfoundries在這一點或許佔有優勢。市調公司VLSI Research董事長兼執行長Dan Hutcheson說：「他們（TSMC）沒有AMD的先進工程技術。」Globalfoundries是由AMD獨立分出，而台積電在40奈米級製程遭遇困難，為Globalfoundries提供了大好機會。
但Hutcheson也提醒：「TSMC有驚人的成本效率，而且他們可以很快地轉換。那是他們擁有60％到70％市佔率的原因。」迅速轉換何以如此重要？他說：「如果你太晚進入市場，會在幾週之內失去大部分的市佔率。晶片必須能夠用在聖誕節上架的電子產品內，你不能延誤聖誕節（購物檔期）。」
Malta的晶圓廠在2012年完工後，應是全球最先進的晶片廠之一。Globalfoundries目前的規劃是在2012下半年啟用28奈米技術，然後迅速轉換至22奈米。當今最先進的晶片是採取40和45奈米製程。嚴格限制本身技術只用在自己產品的英特爾公司，將在今年稍後或明年初，大規模轉換至32奈米製程。
與IBM合作
Globalfoundries的另一項競爭優勢，是與IBM的緊密關係。Hutcheson指出，同樣是全球頂尖晶片商的IBM，也是Globalfoundries選擇Malta興建廠區的原因之一。IBM的晶片開發與製造據點正在紐約的East Fishkill。
上個月，Globalfoundries在日本京都的2009 Symposium on VLSI Technology（半導體技術國際會議）上宣布，該公司正與IBM合作開發能讓電晶體縮至22奈米以下的技術。雙方交流之密切，從人員配置即可看出。 Carvill表示，目前共有70位Globalfoundries工程師在IBM工作，且「數量還會增加」。

-=-=-TEXT: Gone are the days when huge computers made of vacuum tubes sat humming in entire dedicated rooms and could do about 360 multiplications of 10 digit numbers in a second. Though they were heralded as the fastest computing machines of that time, they surely don’t stand a chance when compared to the modern day machines. Modern day computers are getting smaller, faster, and cheaper and more power efficient every progressing second. But what drove this change? The whole domain of computing ushered into a new dawn of electronic miniaturization with the advent of semiconductor transistor by Bardeen (1947-48) and then the Bipolar Transistor by Shockley (1949) in the Bell Laboratory.    
Since the invention of the first IC (Integrated Circuit) in the form of a Flip Flop by Jack Kilby in 1958, our ability to pack more and more transistors onto a single chip has doubled roughly every 18 months, in accordance with the Moore’s Law. Such exponential development had never been seen in any other field and it still continues to be a major area of research work.    
The development of microelectronics spans a time which is even lesser than the average life expectancy of a human, and yet it has seen as many as four generations. Early 60’s saw the low density fabrication processes classified under Small Scale Integration (SSI) in which transistor count was limited to about 10. This rapidly gave way to Medium Scale Integration in the late 60’s when around 100 transistors could be placed on a single chip.   
It was the time when the cost of research began to decline and private firms started entering the competition in contrast to the earlier years where the main burden was borne by the military. Transistor-Transistor logic (TTL) offering higher integration densities outlasted other IC families like ECL and became the basis of the first integrated circuit revolution. It was the production of this family that gave impetus to semiconductor giants like Texas Instruments, Fairchild and National Semiconductors. Early seventies marked the growth of transistor count to about 1000 per chip called the Large Scale Integration.    
By mid eighties, the transistor count on a single chip had already exceeded 1000 and hence came the age of Very Large Scale Integration or VLSI. Though many improvements have been made and the transistor count is still rising, further names of generations like ULSI are generally avoided. It was during this time when TTL lost the battle to MOS family owing to the same problems that had pushed vacuum tubes into negligence, power dissipation and the limit it imposed on the number of gates that could be placed on a single die.

In test mode test patterns are applied in random fashion to the circuit under circuit. This increases switching transition between the consecutive test patterns and thereby increases dynamic power dissipation. The proposed ring counter based ATPG reduces vertical switching transitions by inserting test vectors only between the less correlative test patterns. This paper presents the RC-ATPG with an external circuit. The external circuit consists of XOR gates, full adders, and multiplexers. First the total number of transitions between the consecutive test patterns is determined. If it is more, then the external circuit generates and inserts test vectors in between the two test patterns. Test vector insertion increases the correlation between the test patterns and reduces dynamic power dissipation. The results prove that the test patterns generated by the proposed ATPG have fewer transitions than the conventional ATPG. Experimental results based on ISCAS’85 and ISCAS’89 benchmark circuits show 38.5% reduction in the average power and 50% reduction in the peak power attained during testing with a small size decoding logic. 1. Introduction 
Built-in self-test (BIST) is a design-for-test (DFT) technique in which testing is achieved through built-in hardware features. The steps in a typical BIST approach are as follows: (1) on-chip test pattern generation (TPG); (2) application of patterns to the circuit under test (CUT); (3) analysis of CUT responses via on-chip output response analyzer (ORA); (4) making decision whether chip is faulty or not. 
Efficient TPG design is related to step (1) and it is an important subject in BIST. 
Generation of test vector sequences with low power consumption and high fault coverage in minimal hardware size is the main objective of this proposed approach. 
In recent years, power consumption during testing has become an important issue in test manufacturing because high circuit activity rate during test generation and/or high fan-out of BIST components may result in passing the package power consumption limits which in turn may risk the health of the test [ 1 , 2 ]. 
Power consumption of VLSI during test application can be as high as 200% of that in normal mode as reported in [ 2 , 3 ]. 
Therefore, reducing power consumption in test mode is becoming an important objective in circuit design. The techniques used in [ 4 , 5 ] usually incur fewer mathematical constraints but require a variable-length encoding of the test cubes, and this complicates the communication between the ATE and the chips. 
Thermal-aware methodology [ 6 ] can save 17.5% more power consumed by the repeaters but it allows delay. In [ 7 , 8 ], low transition test vector is inserted between two consecutive patterns, even if there are a few number of transitions. This method increases testing time. The hybrid method [ 9 ] only concentrated on avoiding repeated pattern generation and the methods in [ 10 , 11 ] are used for reduction of the memory size needed for test pattern storage. 
In the proposed scheme, the multiple seeds are stored in ROM, which are used to skip the nondetecting vectors. For each seed, the inputs of CUT are divided into two groups (partial-acting inputs and partial-freezing inputs) according to determined number of transitions. If number of transitions increased, test vectors are generated using random bits insertion and frozen partial test pattern. This decreases vertical transitions, reducing dynamic power dissipation. 
In [ 12 – 14 ] a twisted ring counter along with some reseeding logic is employed to generate the required patterns. A control unit is used to load seed patterns into the input scan registers and to perform the TRC operations so as to generate more patterns from the seeds. But the experimental results show that long test application time is still needed to achieve complete fault coverage. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 , prior work regarding TPG is given. Section 3 describes the proposed ATPG circuit and the state diagram of FSM which is used to implement the proposed scheme. It is followed by hardware implementation small size (8-bit CUT) circuit in Section 4 . Section 5 presents experimental results for the ISCAS benchmark circuits. Section 6 concludes the paper. 2. Prior Work 
Many schemes were proposed for generating low power test patterns using LFSR as ATPG. In some methods two clocks are used which also increase power dissipation. The method using RSIC (random single input change) test generation generates low transition test patterns but at additional cost for reducing power. 
In one method using LFSR as TPG, flip flops are divided into two sets which make the circuit complex. In this paper, ring counter is used as test pattern generator and an external circuit is added with TPG for reducing switching transitions makes the circuit simple. 3. Proposed RC-ATPG 
The general architecture of the proposed scheme is shown in Figure 1 with ROM and CUT. The seeds are fed from ROM to ATPG whenever it is needed. The TPG is nothing but a ring counter (RC) which generates test patterns. Each test pattern is applied to switching transition counter (STC) circuit to determine its number of switching transitions before it is sent to CUT. Depending upon the number of transitions FSM generates outputs. The outputs are applied as select lines to bit selector circuits. If the test pattern has more number of transitions, test vectors are inserted by BSC which reduces vertical transitions. Figure 1: General architecture of the proposed method. 
With regular interval, seed value is applied from ROM, to avoid the same pattern generation. Seed value is applied in parallel which reduces the time for seed application. Seed value is obtained using any optimization algorithm. Normally in test pattern generation genetic algorithm is used as optimization algorithm. 
In this RC-based TPG the D-FFs are replaced by modified D-FFs (Figure 3 ). Initially each test pattern is equally divided into two parts as least significant bytes and most significant bytes. Half of the flip flop outputs, that is, LSB of the test pattern, are applied to CUT through bit selector LSB circuit. BSC generates partial insertion bits. The remaining (MSB) half of the test pattern must be frozen during test vector insertion using bit selector MSB circuit. 
During test vector insertion, LSB is replaced by random bits with frozen MSB. First test vector is the combination of present MSB with random bits as LSB. In the next clock pulse actual LSB of new or next test pattern is applied with the same MSB. In both clock pulses (random bit insertion and original LSB of TP) MSB of test pattern is frozen. In the third pulse next MSB is applied. 
In this proposed scheme, all inputs are divided into two groups. One part is the partial-freezing bits, and the other part is the partial insertion bits. In order to implement the proposed scheme, external circuit (STC, FSM, and BSC) is included with RC-based TPG. 3.1. RC-ATPG 
Normally, ring counter is constructed by any type of flip flops in which the previous output of flip flop is applied as input to the successive flip flop and the last flip flop output is connected with the first flip flop input. 
The proposed TPG is implemented using ring counter, which is constructed by using modified D-flip flops (see Figure 2 ). Each D-FF is combined with multiplexer which is known as modified flip flop. The initial value (seed) is applied to TPG to start test pattern generation. The operation of the register is deterministic; the stream of values produced by the register is completely determined by its current (or previous) state. The output of TPG is directly connected with first FF, which forms a ring counter (RC). Figure 2: Ring counter ATPG. Figure 3: Modified flip flop. 
Modified flip flop (M-FF) is the combination of D-FF and multiplexer. It has 4 inputs and only one output. Select line of MUX is used to input the seed value or for ring operation which generates test patterns. 
M-FF has five input lines and one output line. It works as in Table 1 . Multiplexer selects either seed input or next test pattern bit. The output of multiplexer is applied to D-FF. Flip flop with enable signal is used here. During test vector insertion, the test pattern generation must be hold using the enable signal. Table 1: Operation performed by modified FF. 
Seed is stored in ROM and applied in parallel by asserting the select input of M-FF as “1”. If the select input of M-FF is “0” then the ring counter starts to generate test patterns using ring operation. With regular interval seed must be applied from ROM to avoid the same test pattern generation. Seeds are also used to generate test patterns that have high fault coverage. 
Here each flip flop is replaced by modified flip flop. Initially the seed value is applied by asserting the select line which is equal to logic “1”. Then the select line is deserted and the ring operation is started which generates test patterns. The test patterns are applied through BSC/FC circuit (which reduces vertical switching transitions) to CUT. 3.2. Switching Transition Counter 
Switching transition counter consists of XOR gates, full adders, and an OR gate. Each consecutive test pattern bit is applied to XOR gate. If the test bits are not the same then the XOR gate output is 1. These 1’s are added using full adders. 
More numbers of 1’s give carry output of full adder equal to 1. More numbers of carry = 1 indicate that the number of transitions between consecutive test patterns is more. The carry output of full adders is given to an OR gate. The OR gate output is applied as input to the FSM. 
XOR gates are used to check the transition between horizontal bits. The number of required XOR gates is equal to where “” is number of bits in the test pattern. The carry outputs of all full adders are ORed to check the total number transitions. 
Figure 4 shows ST counter for an 8-bit TPG circuit. The number of XOR gates, full adders, and OR gate depends on the number of CUT inputs and it can be reduced according to our requirement. If the number of test pattern bits is more, then the successive carry outputs are AND ed before applied to the OR gate. Figure 4: Switching transition counter. 3.3. Finite State Machine 
FSM has a single input, three outputs (, , and en), and 3 states. State diagram of FSM is shown in Figure 5 . Output of STC is the input for FSM. It generates outputs and which are the select line for BSC and freezer multiplexer. The three states are A, B, C and the initial state of FSM is A. Figure 5: State diagram of FSM. 
Depending on the input “,” FSM changes its states. The outputs of FSM are applied as select inputs to BSC. During state A, the outputs are . For B state . In state A new test pattern is generated and its transitions are calculated. 
More numbers of transitions are indicated by the input equal to 1 from STC circuit. Table 2 shows the function performed at each state of FSM. During B state random bits are inserted in LSB portion of test pattern. In B and C states partial pattern (MSB) is frozen. The above process is done for each pattern that is generated by ring counter. Test vectors are inserted between the consecutive patterns which are having high transitions. Table 2: Function performed at each FSM state. 
The function performed in each state of FSM is as follows: StateA: . The generated new test pattern is sent to CUT directly, if it has less vertical switching transitions. StateB: . LSB of test pattern is filled with random bits and MSB of present test pattern is frozen. StateC: . MSB of present test pattern is frozen and LSB is replaced by the new test pattern bits. StateA: . The MSB is replaced by new test pattern and LSB is kept as it is. FSM generates enable signal also. This enable output is given to each M-FF, to disable test pattern generation during test vector insertion. Enable is logic “0” in states B and C. At state A, it is logic “1” which starts the test pattern generation. 3.4. Bit Selector Circuit 
BSC is used for test vector generation and insertion. Separate circuit arrangement is used for LS bits and MS bits of TPG outputs (see Figures 6(a) and 6(b) ). For 8-bit TPG the least 4 FF outputs are connected with BSC-LSB and remaining most significant output bits are applied to BSC-MSB circuits. Figure 6: (a) Bit selector circuit, LSB. (b) Bit selector circuit, MSB. 
BSC-LSB is constructed by using 2:1 multiplexers with simple AND gate. The output line from FSM is applied as select input. LSB of each test vector is either next TP bit or random bit. Random bit “” is the AND gate output of present and next test pattern bits (, ). For only one clock pulse the LSB is replaced with random bits. In next two pulses LSB is filled with new test pattern bits. 
In BSC-MSB only one 2:1 multiplexer is used. FSM output is used as select line and it selects either present or next test pattern bits. For first two clock pulses MSB is not changed. It remains on present test pattern and the third clock pulse new test pattern is applied at MS portion. 
BSC generates test vectors which are inserted between consecutive test patterns to reduce vertical transition between consecutive test patterns. 
Random bit “” is AND output of present and next test pattern: 
“” is used to reduce switching transition during test mode. It needs a simple AND gate. In the method proposed in [ 15 ] a separate primary input line for random bit insertion is needed. But in this method random bit is generated using present and next test pattern values which avoid the primary input line. 
Random bit generated using present and next test pattern also decreases the number of vertical transitions. Random bit generated in this proposed method is either present test pattern bit or next test pattern bit. Therefore the random bit insertion does not increase unnecessary switching transition between two test patterns. 4. Implementation of Proposed Method for 8-Bit CUT 
An 8-bit CUT requires 8-bit test pattern input during test mode. Therefore proposed TPG is constructed using 8 modified flip flops (see Figure 7 ). The least four (FF 0 to FF 3 ) flip flop outputs are given to BSC-LSB, and the outputs of FF 4 to FF 7 are applied to BSC-MSB (simple MUX) circuit. The bit select circuit outputs are given as test mode inputs to the CUT. Figure 7: Implementation of proposed method. 
Eight-bit seed is applied from ROM to RC-TPG when the select input line “sel” is “1”. Initially “sel” is asserted and seed is applied from ROM. Then “sel” is changed to logic “0” and ring operation is started which produces test patterns. With particular interval seed should be given to avoid repeated test pattern generation. For each clock a test pattern is generated by the ring counter. 
The generated patterns are given to STC to find the total number of switching transitions. If the number of transitions is more test vectors are inserted between test patterns by BS circuit. 
For an 8-bit CUT, eight XOR gates, two full adders, and an OR gate are required to construct STC circuit. BSC needs 4 AND gates (for random bit generation) and eight multiplexers (2:1 MUX). FSM has one input line and 3 output lines. 
During state B, BSC-LSB replaces the least significant test pattern bits into random bits for test vector generation. The MSB should be frozen for both random bit insertion time and LSB release time. In the third state MSB is changed into next test pattern value. 
Test vectors are formed by MSB of present test pattern and random bits or new test pattern value of LSB. The test vectors are sent to CUT in between two consecutive test patterns which increase the correlation. The patterns with less switching transitions are sent to CUT directly. Figure 8 shows a small example of inserting test vectors between two consecutive test patterns fed to CUT. Figure 8: Generated test patterns for 8-bit CUT. TP 1 and TP 2 : consecutive test patterns; and : test vectors. 5. Experimental Results 
The proposed RC-TPG was implemented using Xilinx software (verilog language) in which VCD should be generated after simulation. The obtained results proved that the 50% of dynamic power dissipation is reduced by test vector insertion. 
Test patterns sent to CUT have less horizontal and vertical transition than generated test patterns. In between high transition patterns test vectors are inserted (A1 and A5) to reduce number of transitions (see Figure 8 ). Test vectors are formed using random bits which are shown in bold letters. The new test vector is generated by combining a part from present test pattern and another part from random bit insertion. The random bits reduce transition between consecutive patterns. 
Table 3 shows the peak and average power of LFSR and proposed TPG (RC-ATPG) for ISCAS benchmarks. As expected, RC-ATPG reduces the average and peak power. The proposed ATPG reduces up to 38.5% and 50% of the average and peak power, respectively. Table 3: Power reduction for ISCAS benchmarks. 
In the proposed ATPG external circuit consists of switching transition counter, FSM, and bit selector circuit. The FSM size is fixed. Table 4 shows the area overhead when RC-TPG is used for test pattern generation. Compared to conventional method the area overhead increases up to 12% and for large circuits it is negligible. Table 4: Comparison with area overhead. 
The experimental results (Table 4 ) clearly show that the proposed method can be implemented for large designs with low area hardware. 6. Summary and Conclusion 
A novel ATPG using ring counter with reduced dynamic power dissipation is proposed in this paper. The power consumption reduction is achieved by partial insertion of random bits at LS portion and partial freezing of remaining MS bits using external circuit. Adding a simple external circuit (constructed by basic XOR, AND gate, and 2:1 multiplexer) the high transition test patterns are identified and the number of vertical transitions is reduced. Ring counter is used as test pattern generator which makes test pattern generation method simple to understand. 
Seed is applied in parallel using modified FF which can reduce the time for seed application. Using switching transition counter, less correlative patterns are identified, which avoids unnecessary insertion of test vector in between all consecutive test patterns and reduces testing time. Thus the consecutive test patterns that have few transitions only applied to the CUT. This reduces dynamic power dissipation without affecting the fault coverage. This method proposes a simple ATPG circuit using basic multiplexers and ring counter which generates low transition test patterns. Therefore it can be expanded for large circuits easily.

-=-=-TEXT: VLSI (very large-scale integration) is the current level of computer microchip miniaturization and refers to microchips containing in the hundreds of thousands of transistor s. LSI (large-scale integration) meant microchips containing thousands of transistors. Earlier, MSI (medium-scale integration) meant a microchip containing hundreds of transistors and SSI (small-scale integration) meant transistors in the tens.

-=-=-TEXT:   This collection of 102 TSP instances was provided by Andre Rohe, based on VLSI data sets studied at the Forschungsinstitut für Diskrete Mathematik, Universität Bonn.  The Bonn Institute is a leading academic site for applied research in VLSI design.    
  The instances in the VLSI collection range in size from 131 cities up to 744,710 cities.  In these examples, the cost of travel between cities is specified by the Eulidean distance rounded to the nearest whole number (the TSPLIB EUC_2D-norm).  Like the National TSPs, this collection porivides additional tests to complement the TSPLIB set of instances.  The VLSI collection is presented in a group of 11 pages, with 10 instances per page.  The entire collection can also be downloaded as a single gzipped tar file vlsi_tsp.tgz.    
  We will be most happy to report any improved tours or improved lower bounds that you may find.  A summary of the current solution status for the instances can be found here.

-=-=-TEXT:                                            CONCURRENCY & VLSI
                "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."
       - Leonardo da Vinci -              
        Research in Alain Martin's lab is about developing design methods that       can cope with the increasing complexity of modern computing       systems--hardware or software--with an emphasis in the areas of       concurrency and Asynchronous VLSI.  Our interest in VLSI  was       triggered by the observation that a modern VLSI circuit is mostly a       complex distributed system on a chip. Other research topics include       concurrent algorithms, languages, and semantics; and parallel machine       architectures.        
ASYNCHRONOUS VLSI -- Currently, our main       research topic is asynchronous VLSI. A digital circuit is called       "asynchronous" when it doesn't use a clock, and therefore such circuits       lend themselves perfectly to a high-level synthesis approach.              We believe that the complexity and brittleness of today's VLSI systems       requires new design methods based on asynchronous techniques,       concurrency, high-level synthesis, and verification.

  CONCURRENCY IN COMPUTATION -- Concurrency has      been the leading thread of the group research, and the theoretical basis      on which the Caltech asynchronous design method was built. Some of the      concurrency work predates the asynchronous VLSI activity, including:       
 the introduction of the notion of slack and the probe               construct.
 various concurrent algorithms, among which: "on-the-fly garbage               collection" (as one of EWD's co-authors), distributed mutual               exclusion with message-passing, a generalization of Dekker's               algorithm for mutual exclusion with shared variables.
 the work on message-passing parallel machine architectures and              the "processing surface" paradigm.
                Some of the concurrency work was developed as part of the asynchronous         VLSI activity, like:        
 the design of the concurrent language CHP.
 synthesis by program transformations.
 the theory of slack elasticity and slack matching.

-=-=-TEXT: Very-large-scale integration (VLSI) is the process of building miniaturized electronic circuits, consisting mainly of semiconductor devices, called transistors, on the surface of a thin substrate of semiconductor material. These circuits, often referred as electronic chips, are used in almost all electronic equipment in use today and have revolutionized the world of electronics.
The dimension of transistors has been reduced to a fraction of a micrometer. With the aid of nanotechnology, the size of transistor may approach several nanometers. The decreasing transistor sizes make VLSI circuits faster, evidenced by the more than 1000-fold speedup of microprocessors. Large electronic chips today contain several hundreds of millions of transistors. The VLSI chips of a figure-tip size can provide functions that were delivered by thousands of print circuit-boards before.
The VLSI research has many aspects. All transistors must be properly placed and connected so that the entire circuit can operate at high frequencies. The power consumption of circuits needs to be reduced. The reliability and testability must be addressed. The VLSI design is closely related to fabrication processes and therefore research on solid-state materials is also performed.
The design of VLSI circuits is a major challenge. Consequently, it is impossible to solely rely on manual design approaches. Computer Aided Design (CAD) is widely used, which is also referred as electronic design automation (EDA). In EDA, computer programs are created to develop VLSI circuits. In CAD research, both software and hardware activities are conducted to improve design quality and reduce design time.

-=-=-TEXT:  		
 				Very large scale integration (VLSI) è una denominazione generica che indica una elevata integrazione di transistor all'interno di un singolo chip. Questa denominazione venne utilizzata fin dagli anni ottanta per indicare quei dispositivi che allora sfruttavano le più avanzate tecnologie disponibili per la realizzazione di circuiti integrati.
 Inizialmente ogni chip conteneva un solo transistor, in seguito con lo sviluppo tecnologico in un chip furono integrati sempre più transistor aumentando la cosiddetta scala di integrazione. Con i miglioramenti tecnologici il numero aumentò vertiginosamente. Tutti i microprocessori sono VLSI.
 La prima generazione di computer utilizzava valvole termoioniche. In seguito si iniziarono ad utilizzare i primi transistor e in seguito i chip con più transistor. La prima generazione era la generazione Small-Scale Integration (SSI) che integrava un ridotto numero di componenti come diodi, resistenze, capacità e ovviamente transistor in un singolo chip. Questa tecnologia consentiva di realizzare porte logiche. In seguito la tecnologia Large-Scale Integration (LSI) permise la realizzazione di molte porte logiche in un singolo chip. La tecnologia VLSI permetteva un'integrazione almeno dieci volte maggiore della LSI. L'attuale tecnologia consente l'integrazione di decine di milioni di porte logiche in un singolo chip.
 Allo stato attuale (2012) la tecnologia di punta è in grado di integrare fino a 4,3 miliardi di transistor in un singolo chip, come nel caso della scheda grafica Radeon HD 7970. La dimensione dei transistor è di 32 nanometri nel migliore dei casi anche se la maggior parte dei microprocessori sono a 45 nanometri mentre in laboratorio si riesce a scendere fino a 16 nm.
 Con la continua evoluzione dei procedimenti produttivi si sono cercate di imporre altre denominazioni tecnologiche successive alla VLSI come la Ultra-large scale integration (ULSI) ma queste denominazioni non hanno avuto successo. Allo stato attuale tutti i chip ad alta tecnologia sono costruiti in tecnologia VLSI o migliore, non si sono diffuse denominazioni successive anche perché ormai si tende a specificare direttamente la dimensione minima dei transistor per indicare la tecnologia costruttiva del chip.

     Q(26)=22.317.699.616.364.044 Möglichkeiten für die   Platzierung von 26 sich nicht bedrohende Damen  auf einem   26x26-Schachbrett.
   Nach fast 10-monatiger Laufzeit hat Queens@TUD  am 11.Juli 2009 seine      Berechnung zum 26-Damenproblem beendet. Bisher ist keine      Vorschrift bekannt, die diese Lösungszahl berechnet, ohne      den Lösungsraum systematisch zu durchsuchen. Queens@TUD  hat diese Suche      hochparallelisiert als Hardwaredesign auf FPGA-Bausteinen      implementiert. Der mit der Berechnung des 25-Damenproblems      im Juli 2005 aufgestellte alte Weltrekord  wurde damit nach      49 Monaten geknackt.

Neben einer vorzüglichen Umsetzung des           Hardware-Entwurfs entstand zusätzlich ein           Sound-Ausgabemodul.

-=-=-TEXT: The VLSI CAD Lab is headed by Prof. Malgorzata Marek-Sadowska. Located in one of the most scenic spots within the UCSB campus and with spectacular ocean views, the lab provides a prefectly calm and nurturing research ambience. Since its inception in 1990, many researchers including graduate students, research scholars, faculty and people from the industry have actively participated in lab's activities. Members at the VLSI CAD Lab have exhibted diverse research interests and have richly contributed to the field of Electronic Design Automation ranging from logic synthesis to manufacturing and more. Some of the most recent research activites are listed below.
Electromigration (EM) reliability is becoming a serious problem for integrated circuit due to feature size shrinking. Interconnects, especially vias, in Power/Ground (P/G) network suffer from significant EM degradation as they carry large current. In this research, we study EM effect on P/G vias, considering uneven current distribution in via array and time-varying current loads. Our target is to detect hotspot via that is prone to EM failure and IR drop sensitive, and intelligently fix detected hotspot vias.

 		Heterogeneous 3D chip with processor cores and cache blocks implemented in CMOS and NoC fabric in VeSFET technology shows significant improvements in all network parameters including latency, power, and energy consumption compared to other practical 3D NoC.
 		Recently, CPU and GPU have been integrated in one chip. No exploration tool exists for studying a CPU+GPU, cache, and NoC together on 3D architectures. We are working on developing such a tool for 3D heterogeneous structures that will allow designers to quantify various architectural solutions from a physical design standpoint.

VeSFET physical design: Vertical Slit Field Effect Transistor (VeSFET) is a novel twin-gate 3D device. VeSFETs are very attractive for low power applications because they have very small gate capacitance and extremely low leakage current. Layouts of VeSFET ICs are very different from traditional CMOS. Transistors are packed into regular arrays with much higher density than CMOS ICs, leading to smaller footprint, shorter interconnects, hence higher performance and lower power. Currently, our research topics include VeSFET physical design (placement & routing), testing strategies and low power applications.

Testing Analog Components in SoCs: Analog components in system on chip designs (SoC) have proven to be very difficult to test within the digital design verification flow. These components are simulated and verified using SPICE, which can be very time consuming for more complex components. We propose a machine learning method that will automatically create a behavioral System Verilog macromodel that removes the need for any SPICE simulation and can be tested using available EDA digital design tools.

-=-=-TEXT:  		
 VLSI Technology, Inc war ein Unternehmen das anwendungsspezifische integrierte Schaltungen (kurz ASIC oder auch Custom Chip) als integrierte Schaltkreise entwarf, produzierte und vertrieb. Sitz des Unternehmens war Silicon Valley, 1109 McKay Drive in San José (Kalifornien). Da die Funktionen dieser neuen Mikrochips damit nicht mehr manipulierbar waren und die Herstellungskosten geringer ausfielen, wurden diese zur Kostensenkung in Seriengeräten als anwendungsspezifische Standardprodukte (ASSP) verbaut. Das in den späten 1970er Jahren von Douglas Fairbairn, Jack Balletto, Dan Floyd und Gunnar Weslesen gegründete[1] Unternehmen VLSI Technology bildete zusammen mit LSI Logic den Hauptgeschäftsbereich für anwendungsspezifische integrierte Schaltungen (ASIC).
 
 Im Jahr 1982 wurde Alfred J. Stein zum Chief Executive Officer (Geschäftsführer) des Unternehmens bestellt. Anschließend eröffnete VLSI seine erste Fabrik in San Jose und in weiterer Folge eine zweite Produktionsstätte in San Antonio, Texas. 1983 erfolgte der Börsengang. Das Unternehmen wurde später von Philips Electronics übernommen und besteht bis heute als Teil von NXP Semiconductors.
 VLSI war einer der Pioniere in der Electronic Design Automation und war zu Beginn der 80er Jahre ein führender Hersteller von Standardzellen. Vor der Einführung der VLSI Zelle war die Produktion in erster Linie nur großen Unternehmen in der Halbleitertechnik wie AT&T und IBM vorbehalten. VLSI ermöglichte durch ASIC die Herstellung von maßgeschneiderten Chips, um bestimmte, für den jeweiligen Aufgabenbereich nötige, Anwendungen zu erledigen.
 VLSI erste große Innovation war ein Workstation-System, dass es erlaubte Halbleiterprodukte individuell und effektiv zu gestalten um eigene Chips zu entwerfen. Durch die Einführung dieses Systems in den 1980er Jahren konnte VLSI deren Umsatz in kurzer Zeit erheblich steigern. Bis Mitte der 1990er Jahre stieg VLSI zu einem anerkannter Marktführer im Chipsatz Geschäft auf. Das Unternehmen entwarf und fertigte Chips, die grundlegenden Logik-Komponenten (engl. core logic) in Computern mit diversen Mikroprozessoren und Peripheriegeräten verknüpften.
 Globale Expansion [ Bearbeiten ]
 VLSI expandierte in die USA, Großbritannien, Frankreich, Deutschland, Italien, Japan, Singapur und Taiwan. Einer der wichtigsten Standorte war in Tempe (Arizona), wo eine Familie von sehr erfolgreichen Chipsätzen für den IBM-PC entwickelt wurde. Das schwedische Unternehmen Ericsson war 1998 VLSIs größter Kunde. Im Bereich der Wireless-Produkte entwickelt VLSI eine Reihe von Algorithmen und Schaltungen für den GSM-Standard und für schnurlose Standards wie den europäischen DECT und den japanischen PHS.
 Durch das Wachstum und den Erfolg von VLSI in der drahtlosen Mobilteil-IC-Branche aufmerksam geworden, erwarb schließlich Philips Electronics VLSI im Juni 1999. Die ehemaligen Komponenten von VLSI bestehen bis heute als Teil der Philips-Ausgründung NXP Semiconductors.

-=-=-TEXT: Interconnects play an increasing role in all electronic and information   systems, allowing fast and high bandwidth communication both on-chip and   off-chip.
Synchronization of systems with robust and adaptive clocking systems are                  a very important aspect of the most advanced multi-core microprocessors. 
3D technologies are emerging and present great opportunities but also new                 challenges in interconnect, thermal issues, mixed-technologies and power delivery. 
Power consumption continues to be a challenge in battery-powered,                  wall-powered and now even wirelessly-powered systems.  Increased power density                  and especially device leakage, leads to increasing temperature which must be sensed                  and mitigated   both at design-time and run-time.
Side-channel Leakage and On-Chip Monitors:  Power consumption,  timing information, temperature, faults and electromagnetic radiation all can be monitored to optimize the system as well as to attack and divulge secret information in the system.
 Finally, computation and communication  in the presence of uncertain manufacturing                  process, voltage noise and temperature has become a primary design issue.

-=-=-TEXT: In response to the increasing challenges in maintaining technology advancements through traditional scaling at a pace consistent with Moore's law, alternative methods to achieve enhanced system level performance are becoming increasingly important. 3D Technology has the potential to provide significant performance enhancements for several generations.  Realization of this technology will require collaborative research and development across system architecture, design, and technology.    Significant changes to the basic circuit design, layout procedures and tools flow, as well as the routing of global signals and supplies (power/ground distribution, clock distribution, and I/O), will be required to accommodate the 3D technology features in stacked active chip designs. These changes can only be understood through a detailed evaluation of the impact of each of the unique 3D technology elements on the design.  The Research Division is involved in leading the exploration of these new aspects of 3D VLSI chip design for future systems.

-=-=-TITLE:  UCSD VLSI CAD Laboratory
-=-=-SNIPPET:  sn. Moore
-=-=-TEXT: Semiconductor technology has been driven by digital VLSI since the early 1980's. Moore's law is based upon shrinkage of digital VLSI. Almost any electronic function one wants to do can be done in digital VLSI (albeit not always the most efficient way).
Having acknowledged that digital VLSI drives the semiconductor and electronics industries, there are just some functions that don't make sense to implement in digital form. The world we live in is an analog place. Many functions are most efficiently treated in the analog domain.
Since there is benefit in integrating these analog functions onto primarily digital VLSI devices, a whole technology has grown up in implementing analog functions using the constrained performance parameters of digital VLSI. The constrained performance parameters are low voltage transistors optimized for switching and poor range and parameter control for traditional analog passive devices. Also, they must operate in a noisy environment. The development of analog functions that can operate under these conditions are, not surprisingly, known as Analog VLSI.
A colleague of yours asked me the same question recently, so here is the same answer, word for word.
I'll give you a few pointers, but i won't do your homework for you.
analogue:
resolution infinite in theory, but in practice greatly limited by noise
all VLSI can be seen as 'analogue' at a transistor level, though designers are not often concerned with this
usually kept for smaller circuits, with fewer transistors due to noise
digital
phase is less troublesome, instead, the overall line delay should be within the clock tree skew limit
CMOS smaller, more efficient, but far denser as more transistors are needed
can  perform complex mathematical formulae, but it is challenging for a  designer to accomplish certain tasks (i.e. integration) with boolean  logic.
it's massive: the only circuits into ULSI (bns of transistors) are digital
There  is a considerable grey area called Analogue mixed-signal (AMS). Most  mobile SoCs tend to use a BiCMOS hybrid process or others that allow the  a chip to be both digital and analogue.
analogue VLSI applications:
integrated  circuit radiofrequency modulator for a GSM/CDMA handset. these chips  are often separated from the rest of the phone for grounding reasons.  such an integrated solution would connect directly to the PCB microstrip  antenna with minimal external circuitry. When they first appeared i  think they were based on III-V materials like Gallium Arsenide (GaAs).  now achievable with silicon.
In digital VLSI electronics, we only care about ones and zeros. Everything else is noise which we try to get rid of by buffering, spacing out tracks, pipelining with flip-flops etc. At the physical level these circuits can just be made with NMOS and PMOS transistors with metallisation. This can be done with 20 or so layers of processing on the basic silicon wafer. To make analogue electronics we also need resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and bipolar transistors, and if we want flash memory as well we need floating gate MOS transistors as well, making a total of around 35 layers of processing. Each layer requires a UV light to shine on the chip using some kind of photo-sensitive material together with an object called a reticule which contains several copies of the outline of the chip. The maximum size of chip is limited by the reticule size and the inherent defectively. An additional difficulty is that the feature size in a modern process is smaller than the wavelength of UV-light causing interference which has to be compensated with even more complexity. This makes the templates (known as the mask set) for a chip very expensive to make, usually in the millions of dollars range, and even more so if you use analogue techniques. So the only chips that are viable to cover the up-front costs and engineers salaries are high-volume items (ARM processors, DRAM, flash memory, Wifi, GPS, Bluetooth) or those that can command a high price such as FPGAs, desktop processors, 3G phone baseband chips. The most successful companies are those that know how to combine these elements in ways that appeal to the end customer and also achieve reliability in software and long battery life. This is an oversimplified description of what goes on - there are huge numbers of engineers involved which I haven't even mentioned, for example computer aided design software engineers, manufacturing test programmes, verification experts, RF experts, PCB specialists, reliability engineering, foundry specialists, product designers. Many of these people are Geeks who influence our modern world in a profound but hidden way, not immediately obvious to the men/women in the street who walk by oblivious to them.
For example let me put it this way..
You design a basic gate from scratch using transistors of different width and other parameters based on the given requirement - This is analog design.
You use the already designed gates to design a module - This is digital design.
Although, it's not only gates. Other modules like ADC, DAC, MUX etc. comes under Analog design. Digital design is more like representing a given problem statement in Boolean form (using standard gates).
Coming to education, in digital design, you focus mainly on speed, power and area. Whereas in analog design, you focus on speed, power, area, linearity, sensitivity, SNR etc.
As far as I know, analog jobs are usually high pay jobs, but more jobs are in digital domain.
Digital VLSI concerns with just two values, ON or OFF or in boolean representation, 0 or 1. Entire processing is done on these two values in different forms. For example if you want to represent four values, instead of just ON or OFF, you use two boolean variables, which represent 00, 01, 10, 11 - four values. 
Analog VLSI acts on a range of values, not just ON or OFF, and also involves stuff like SNR, Gain, (which I have only a minimal idea about).
Take a practical example: Most of the things in nature are not boolean or digital. For instance, speed of the wind, it varies and is not either 0 or 1. But the computers which make the weather predictions are digital, which makes them inherently faster and easier to implement. The design aspect of the computer is digital, whereas if you have a device which measures wind speed, it would need to convert the analog to digital signals to be processed by the computer.

-=-=-TEXT: The work in computer-aided design is divided into two groups. The high-level synthesis group is investigating issues in mapping behavioral specifications to register transfer level representations. Of particular interest are the application areas of fault-tolerance and testing. How to incorporate detection and recovery in microarchitecture synthesis, and effective incorporation of built-in self-test structures during high-level synthesis are being researched. An interactive framework for high-level synthesis is being developed. Flow-graph restructuring techniques during synthesis provide an efficient method for exploring the design space. Algorithms such as edge-based scheduling, multi-dimensional force-directed scheduling and integer linear programming formulations are being investigated for synthesis.

  ASIC, on the other hand, refers to application specific integrated circuit. It includes the making of those ICs that has been designed for very specific purposes with the desired needs in mind. In our lectures, we are going to talk of some of the most diverse details that can help people in learning the core details of these technologies.
  We have basic lectures for setting the foundation in the field of VLSI technology. Once you have a basic overlay, we are then going to work upon the higher and the advanced concepts like the verification of the design, establishing the communication, low power VLSI and more. Our online lectures are split into a series of different videos. As the videos are segregated under different topics, it becomes a lot easier to understand the matter and assimilate the meaning.
  By going through these online videos, you will be able to get a clear and better understanding of how this whole technology operates.

-=-=-TEXT:    Course Goals:   
 This course is intended to provide the student with the two basic capabilities: 1) To do the early design planning for an embedded SOC using a high level RTL model and 2) To do the circuit feasibility analysis of the critical components of an SOC. Current VLSI issues such as noise analysis, power delivery, power management, timing analysis, clocking, floor-planning/integration, and transistor/wire scaling will be covered. Circuit designers from IBM, Apple, Intel and Everspin Technologies will co-teach the course. The material presented in the course will be as close to state of the art as possible. There will be 3 major homework assignments, a class project and 2 exams; there will be no final exam. The homework assignments focus on circuit feasibility analysis and the project focuses on the early design planning.  
   Course Prerequisites:     
 Student must have already taken the EE382M VLSI-I course and have a background in basic logic and circuit design, with a working knowledge of EDA tools -- specifically HSPICE, Synopsys Design Compiler and Verilog. A basic understanding of microprocessor architecture is mandatory to complete the class project.  
   Class Project:     
 This class project assignment will be given out during first day of class to provide plenty of time to complete it (the project takes all semester to complete and is a lot of work). There will be midterm reviews March 9 and 11, and the final design reviews are on May 4 and 6.  The project report is due May 8.  Class attendees will be assigned to teams to do the various components of the design, subject to constraints on area, performance and power.  The intent of the project is to do the early design planning of an embedded SOC. The ARM M0 processor core and various peripherals will be used for this project.

-=-=-TEXT:  We already know that Layout is drawing version of the mask (mask which used in the manufacturing process). We should also know that Layout can’t be perfectly reproduced on the wafer. There are number of reasons and facts behind that. We will discuss all those separately. Most of the time Foundry knows about the gaps or the constraints of converting the Layout/Mask into the final manufacturable product. So they come up with set of rules which we all should comply. These rules are known as Design Rules.
 Design rules ensure that design is still functional even when there may be lots of misalignments and various side-effects of the fabrication process.
 In the CAD or say EDA (Electronic Design Automation) world, to verify these rules, different tools are developed by the EDA vendors, commonly known as DRC (Design Rule Checking or Checks) tools. 
 Design rules or say layout rules are defined as per the dimensions on wafer. When we draw these rules with the help of CAD tools, it looks to us that we are drawing really a very big diagram but actually if you will notice, there size “unit” is very small. So in short, all this has to be taken care by CAD tools. 
 Design rules are written to verify shapes and sizes of various circuit components that are diffused in, deposited on, or etched on a semiconductor wafer. 
 Remember design rule checks do not validate that the design will operate correctly, they are constructed to verify that the structure meets the process constraints for a given design type and process technology. 
 There is no standard in which language or way the Design rules should be written. Foundries provide the DRM (Design Rule Manual) in the form of pdf or word, where they document all the Rules. 
 For the EDA tools, different vendors have different ways to code these rules in different format, so that their corresponding tools understand those rules and perform corresponding checks accordingly. A set of rules for a particular process is referred to as a run-set, rule deck, or just a deck. 
 Now let’s talk about few examples about the Design Rules. This will help you to understand more clearly from Layout/Design point of view.
 Note: I haven’t write the dimensions of any rule because these can be changed as per the technology and as per the foundry.
