-=-=-TEXT: The Iliad (/  ˈ   ɪ   l   i   ə   d   /;[1]  Ancient Greek: Ἰλιάς Ilias, pronounced [iː.li.ás] in Classical Attic; sometimes referred to as the Song of Ilion or Song of Ilium) is an ancient Greek epic poem in dactylic hexameter, traditionally attributed to Homer. Set during the Trojan War, the ten-year siege of the city of Troy (Ilium) by a coalition of Greek states, it tells of the battles and events during the weeks of a quarrel between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles.
Although the story covers only a few weeks in the final year of the war, the Iliad mentions or alludes to many of the Greek legends about the siege; the earlier events, such as the gathering of warriors for the siege, the cause of the war, and related concerns tend to appear near the beginning. Then the epic narrative takes up events prophesied for the future, such as Achilles' looming death and the sack of Troy, prefigured and alluded to more and more vividly, so that when it reaches an end, the poem has told a more or less complete tale of the Trojan War.
The Iliad is paired with something of a sequel, the Odyssey, also attributed to Homer. Along with the Odyssey, the Iliad is among the oldest extant works of Western literature, and its written version is usually dated to around the eighth century BC.[2] Recent statistical modelling based on language evolution has found it to date to 760–710 BC.[3] In the modern vulgate (the standard accepted version), the Iliad contains 15,693 lines; it is written in Homeric Greek, a literary amalgam of Ionic Greek and other dialects.
(1) After an invocation to the Muses, the story launches in medias res (in the middle of things) towards the end of the Trojan War between the Trojans and the besieging Greeks. Chryses, a Trojan priest of Apollo, offers the Greeks wealth for the return of his daughter Chryseis, a captive of Agamemnon, the Greek leader. Although most of the Greek army is in favour of the offer, Agamemnon refuses. Chryses prays for Apollo's help, and Apollo causes a plague throughout the Greek army.
After nine days of plague, Achilles, the leader of the Myrmidon contingent, calls an assembly to solve the plague problem. Under pressure, Agamemnon agrees to return Chryseis to her father, but also decides to take Achilles's captive, Briseis, as compensation. Angered, Achilles declares that he and his men will no longer fight for Agamemnon, but will go home. Odysseus takes a ship and brings Chryseis to her father, whereupon Apollo ends the plague.
In the meantime, Agamemnon's messengers take Briseis away. Achilles then asks his mother, Thetis, to ask Zeus that the Greeks be brought to breaking point by the Trojans, so Agamemnon will realize how much the Greeks need Achilles. Thetis does so, and Zeus agrees.
(2) Zeus sends a dream to Agamemnon, urging him to attack the city. Agamemnon heeds the dream but decides to first test the morale of the Greek army by telling them to go home. The plan backfires, and only the intervention of Odysseus, inspired by Athena, stops a rout.
Odysseus confronts and beats Thersites, a common soldier who voices discontent at fighting Agamemnon's war. After a meal, the Greeks deploy in companies upon the Trojan plain. The poet takes the opportunity to describe the provenance of each Greek contingent. When news of the Greek deployment reaches king Priam, the Trojans too sortie upon the plain. In a similar list to that for the Greeks, the poet describes the Trojans and their allies.
(3) The armies approach each other on the plain, but before they meet, Paris offers to end the war by fighting a duel with Menelaus, urged by his brother and head of the Trojan army, Hector. While Helen tells Priam about the Greek commanders from the walls of Troy, both sides swear a truce and promise to abide by the outcome of the duel. Paris is beaten, but Aphrodite rescues him and leads him to bed with Helen before Menelaus could kill him.
(4) Pressured by Hera's hatred of Troy, Zeus arranges for the Trojan Pandaros to break the truce by wounding Menelaus with an arrow. Agamemnon rouses the Greeks, and battle is joined.
(5) In the fighting, Diomedes kills many Trojans, including Pandaros, and defeats Aeneas, whom again Aphrodite rescues, but Diomedes attacks and wounds the goddess. Apollo faces Diomedes, and warns him against warring with gods. Many heroes and commanders join in, including Hector, and the gods supporting each side try to influence the battle. Emboldened by Athena, Diomedes wounds Ares and puts him out of action.
(6) Hector rallies the Trojans and stops a rout; the Greek Diomedes and the Trojan Glaukos find common ground and exchange unequal gifts. Hector enters the city, urges prayers and sacrifices, incites Paris to battle, bids his wife Andromache and son Astyanax farewell on the city walls, and rejoins the battle.
(7) Hector duels with Ajax, but nightfall interrupts the fight and both sides retire. The Greeks agree to burn their dead and build a wall to protect their ships and camp, while the Trojans quarrel about returning Helen. Paris offers to return the treasure he took, and give further wealth as compensation, but without returning Helen, and the offer is refused. A day's truce is agreed for burning the dead, during which the Greeks also build their wall and trench.
(8) The next morning, Zeus prohibits the gods from interfering, and fighting begins anew. The Trojans prevail and force the Greeks back to their wall while Hera and Athena are forbidden from helping. Night falls before the Trojans can assail the Greek wall. They camp in the field to attack at first light, and their watchfires light the plain like stars.
(9) Meanwhile, the Greeks are desperate. Agamemnon admits his error, and sends an embassy composed of Odysseus, Ajax, Phoenix, and two heralds to offer Briseis and extensive gifts to Achilles, who has been camped next to his ships throughout, if only he would return to the fighting. Achilles and his companion Patroclus receive the embassy well, but Achilles angrily refuses Agamemnon's offer, and declares that he would only return to battle if the Trojans reach his ships and threaten them with fire. The embassy returns empty-handed.
(10) Later that night, Odysseus and Diomedes venture out to the Trojan lines, killing the Trojan Dolon and wreaking havoc in the camps of some Thracian allies of Troy.
(11) In the morning, the fighting is fierce and Agamemnon, Diomedes, and Odysseus are all wounded. Achilles sends Patroclus from his camp to inquire about the Greek casualties, and while there Patroclus is moved to pity by a speech of Nestor.
(12) The Trojans assault the Greek wall on foot. Hector, ignoring an omen, leads the terrible fighting. The Greeks are overwhelmed in rout, the wall's gate is broken, and Hector charges in.
(13) Many fall on both sides. The Trojan seer Polydamas urges Hector to fall back and warns him about Achilles, but is ignored.
(14) Hera seduces Zeus and lures him to sleep, allowing Poseidon to help the Greeks, and the Trojans are driven back onto the plain.
(15) Zeus awakes and is enraged by Poseidon's intervention. Against the mounting discontent of the Greek-supporting gods, Zeus sends Apollo to aid the Trojans, who once again breach the wall, and the battle reaches the ships.
(16) Patroclus can stand to watch no longer, and begs Achilles to be allowed to defend the ships. Achilles relents, and lends Patroclus his armor, but sends him off with a stern admonition not to pursue the Trojans, lest he take Achilles's glory. Patroclus leads the Myrmidons to battle and arrives as the Trojans set fire to the first ships. The Trojans are routed by the sudden onslaught, and Patroclus begins his assault by killing the Trojan hero Sarpedon. Patroclus, ignoring Achilles's command, pursues and reaches the gates of Troy, where Apollo himself stops him. Patroclus is set upon by Apollo and Euphorbos, and is finally killed by Hector.
(17) Hector takes Achilles's armor from the fallen Patroclus, but fighting develops around Patroclus' body.
(18) Achilles is mad with grief when he hears of Patroclus's death, and vows to take vengeance on Hector; his mother Thetis grieves, too, knowing that Achilles is fated to die young if he kills Hector. Achilles is urged to help retrieve Patroclus' body, but has no armour. Made brilliant by Athena, Achilles stands next to the Greek wall and roars in rage. The Trojans are dismayed by his appearance and the Greeks manage to bear Patroclus' body away. Again Polydamas urges Hector to withdraw into the city, again Hector refuses, and the Trojans camp in the plain at nightfall. Patroclus is mourned, and meanwhile, at Thetis' request, Hephaestus fashions a new set of armor for Achilles, among which is a magnificently wrought shield.
(19) In the morning, Agamemnon gives Achilles all the promised gifts, including Briseis, but he is indifferent to them. Achilles fasts while the Greeks take their meal, and straps on his new armor, and heaves his great spear. His horse Xanthos prophesies to Achilles his death. Achilles drives his chariot into battle.
(20) Zeus lifts the ban on the gods' interference, and the gods freely intervene on both sides. The onslaught of Achilles, burning with rage and grief, is terrible, and he slays many.
(21) Driving the Trojans before him, Achilles cuts off half their number in the river Skamandros and proceeds to slaughter them and fills the river with the dead. The river, angry at the killing, confronts Achilles, but is beaten back by Hephaestus' firestorm. The gods fight among themselves. The great gates of the city are opened to receive the fleeing Trojans, and Apollo leads Achilles away from the city by pretending to be a Trojan.
(22) When Apollo reveals himself to Achilles, the Trojans had retreated into the city, all except for Hector, who, having twice ignored the counsels of Polydamas, feels the shame of rout and resolves to face Achilles, in spite of the pleas of Priam and Hecuba, his parents. When Achilles approaches, Hector's will fails him, and he is chased around the city by Achilles. Finally, Athena tricks him to stop running, and he turns to face his opponent. After a brief duel, Achilles stabs Hector through the neck. Before dying, Hector reminds Achilles that he is fated to die in the war as well. Achilles takes Hector's body and dishonours it.
(23) The ghost of Patroclus comes to Achilles in a dream and urges the burial of his body. The Greeks hold a day of funeral games, and Achilles gives out the prizes.
(24) Dismayed by Achilles' continued abuse of Hector's body, Zeus decides that it must be returned to Priam. Led by Hermes, Priam takes a wagon out of Troy, across the plains, and enters the Greek camp unnoticed. He grasps Achilles by the knees and begs to have his son's body. Achilles is moved to tears, and the two lament their losses in the war. After a meal, Priam carries Hector's body back into Troy. Hector is buried, and the city mourns.
The many characters of the Iliad are catalogued; the latter-half of Book II, the "Catalogue of Ships", lists commanders and cohorts; battle scenes feature quickly slain minor characters.
Much debate has surrounded the nature of the relationship of Achilles and Patroclus, as to whether it can be described as a homoerotic one or not. Classical and Hellenistic Athenian scholars perceived it as pederastic,[4] while others perceived it as a platonic warrior-bond.[5]
In the literary Trojan War of the Iliad, the Olympic gods, goddesses, and demigods fight and play great roles in human warfare. Unlike practical Greek religious observance, Homer's portrayals of them suited his narrative purpose, being very different from the polytheistic ideals Greek society used. To wit, the Classical-era historian Herodotus says that Homer, and his contemporary, the poet Hesiod, were the first artists to name and describe their appearance and characters.[6]
In Greek Gods Human Lives: What We Can Learn From Myths, Mary Lefkowitz discusses the relevance of divine action in the Iliad, attempting to answer the question of whether or not divine intervention is a discrete occurrence (for its own sake), or if such godly behaviors are mere human character metaphors. The intellectual interest of Classic-era authors, such as Thucydides and Plato, was limited to their utility as "a way of talking about human life rather than a description or a truth", because, if the gods remain religious figures, rather than human metaphors, their "existence"—without the foundation of either dogma or a bible of faiths—then allowed Greek culture the intellectual breadth and freedom to conjure gods fitting any religious function they required as a people.[7]  [8]
In The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, psychologist Julian Jaynes uses the Iliad as a major supporting evidence for his theory of Bicameralism, which posits that until about the time described in the Iliad, humans had a much different mentality than present day humans, essentially lacking in what we call consciousness. He suggests that humans heard and obeyed commands from what they identified as gods, until the change in human mentality that incorporated the motivating force into the conscious self. He points out that almost every action in the Iliad is directed, caused, or influenced by a god, and that earlier translations show an astonishing lack of words suggesting thought, planning, or introspection. Those that do appear, he argues, are misinterpretations made by translators imposing a modern mentality on the characters.[9]
Nostos (νόστος, "homecoming") occurs seven times in the poem.[10] Thematically, the concept of homecoming is much explored in Ancient Greek literature, especially in the post-war homeward fortunes experienced by the Atreidae (Agamemnon and Menelaus), and Odysseus (see the Odyssey). Thus, nostos is impossible without sacking Troy—King Agamemnon's motive for winning, at any cost.
Kleos (κλέος, "glory, fame") is the concept of glory earned in heroic battle.[11] For most of the Greek invaders of Troy, notably Odysseus, kleos is earned in a victorious nostos (homecoming). Yet, Achilles must choose only one of the two rewards, either nostos or kleos.[12] In Book IX (IX.410–16), he poignantly tells Agamemnon's envoys—Odysseus, Phoenix, Ajax—begging his reinstatement to battle about having to choose between two fates (διχθαδίας κήρας, 9.411).[13]
The passage reads (the translation is Lattimore's):
In forgoing his nostos, he will earn the greater reward of kleos aphthiton (κλέος ἄφθιτον, "fame imperishable").[13] In the poem, aphthiton (ἄφθιτον, "imperishable") occurs five other times,[16] each occurrence denotes an object: Agamemnon's sceptre, the wheel of Hebe's chariot, the house of Poseidon, the throne of Zeus, the house of Hephaestus. Translator Lattimore renders kleos aphthiton as forever immortal and as forever imperishable—connoting Achilles's mortality by underscoring his greater reward in returning to battle Troy.
Achilles' shield, crafted by Hephaestus and given to him by his mother Thetis, bears an image of stars in the centre. The stars conjure profound images of the place of a single man, no matter how heroic, in the perspective of the entire cosmos.
Akin to kleos is timê (τιμή, "respect, honor"), the concept denoting the respectability an honorable man accrues with accomplishment (cultural, political, martial), per his station in life. In Book I, the Greek troubles begin with King Agamemnon's dishonorable, unkingly behavior—first, by threatening the priest Chryses (1.11), then, by aggravating them in disrespecting Achilles, by confiscating Briseis from him (1.171). The warrior's consequent rancor against the dishonorable king ruins the Greek military cause.
The poem's initial word, μῆνιν (mēnin, accusative of μῆνις, mēnis, "wrath, rage, fury"), establishes the Iliad's principal theme: The "Wrath of Achilles".[17] His personal rage and wounded soldier's vanity propel the story: the Greeks' faltering in battle, the slayings of Patroclus and Hector, and the fall of Troy. In Book I, the Wrath of Achilles first emerges in the Achilles-convoked meeting, between the Greek kings and the seer Calchas. King Agamemnon dishonours Chryses, the Trojan priest of Apollo, by refusing with a threat the restitution of his daughter, Chryseis—despite the proffered ransom of "gifts beyond count".[18] The insulted priest prays his god's help, and a nine-day rain of divine plague arrows falls upon the Greeks. Moreover, in that meeting, Achilles accuses Agamemnon of being "greediest for gain of all men".[19] To that, Agamemnon replies:
But here is my threat to you.
 Even as Phoibos Apollo is taking away my Chryseis.
 I shall convey her back in my own ship, with my own
 followers; but I shall take the fair-cheeked Briseis,
 your prize, I myself going to your shelter, that you may learn well
 how much greater I am than you, and another man may shrink back
 from likening himself to me and contending against me.[20]  
After that, only Athena stays Achilles's wrath. He vows to never again obey orders from Agamemnon. Furious, Achilles cries to his mother, Thetis, who persuades Zeus's divine intervention—favouring the Trojans—until Achilles's rights are restored. Meanwhile, Hector leads the Trojans to almost pushing the Greeks back to the sea (Book XII). Later, Agamemnon contemplates defeat and retreat to Greece (Book XIV). Again, the Wrath of Achilles turns the war's tide in seeking vengeance when Hector kills Patroclus. Aggrieved, Achilles tears his hair and dirties his face. Thetis comforts her mourning son, who tells her:
So it was here that the lord of men Agamemnon angered me.
 Still, we will let all this be a thing of the past, and for all our
 sorrow beat down by force the anger deeply within us.
 Now I shall go, to overtake that killer of a dear life,
 Hektor; then I will accept my own death, at whatever
 time Zeus wishes to bring it about, and the other immortals.[21]  
Accepting the prospect of death as fair price for avenging Patroclus, he returns to battle, dooming Hector and Troy, thrice chasing him 'round the Trojan walls, before slaying him, then dragging the corpse behind his chariot, back to camp.
Fate (κήρ, kēr, "fated death") propels most of the events of the Iliad. Once set, gods and men abide it, neither truly able nor willing to contest it. How fate is set is unknown, but it is told by the Fates and by Zeus through sending omens to seers such as Calchas. Men and their gods continually speak of heroic acceptance and cowardly avoidance of one's slated fate.[22] Fate does not determine every action, incident, and occurrence, but it does determine the outcome of life—before killing him, Hector calls Patroclus a fool for cowardly avoidance of his fate, by attempting his defeat; Patroclus retorts: [23]
No, deadly destiny, with the son of Leto, has killed me,
 and of men it was Euphorbos; you are only my third slayer.
 And put away in your heart this other thing that I tell you.
 You yourself are not one who shall live long, but now already
 death and powerful destiny are standing beside you,
 to go down under the hands of Aiakos' great son, Achilleus.[24]
Here, Patroclus alludes to fated death by Hector's hand, and Hector's fated death by Achilles's hand. Each accepts the outcome of his life, yet, no-one knows if the gods can alter fate. The first instance of this doubt occurs in Book XVI. Seeing Patroclus about to kill Sarpedon, his mortal son, Zeus says:
Ah me, that it is destined that the dearest of men, Sarpedon,
 must go down under the hands of Menoitios' son Patroclus.[25]  
About his dilemma, Hera asks Zeus:
Majesty, son of Kronos, what sort of thing have you spoken?
 Do you wish to bring back a man who is mortal, one long since
 doomed by his destiny, from ill-sounding death and release him?
 Do it, then; but not all the rest of us gods shall approve you.[26]  
In deciding between losing a son or abiding fate, Zeus, King of the Gods, allows it. This motif recurs when he considers sparing Hector, whom he loves and respects. Again, Hera asks him:
Father of the shining bolt, dark misted, what is this you said?
 Do you wish to bring back a man who is mortal, one long since
 doomed by his destiny, from ill-sounding death and release him?
 Do it, then; but not all the rest of us gods shall approve you.[27]  
Again, Zeus appears capable of altering fate, but does not, deciding instead to abide set outcomes; yet, contrariwise, fate spares Aeneas, after Apollo convinces the over-matched Trojan to fight Achilles. Poseidon cautiously speaks:
But come, let us ourselves get him away from death, for fear
 the son of Kronos may be angered if now Achilleus
 kills this man. It is destined that he shall be the survivor,
 that the generation of Dardanos shall not die ...[28]  
Divinely aided, Aeneas escapes the wrath of Achilles and survives the Trojan War. Whether or not the gods can alter fate, they do abide it, despite its countering their human allegiances; thus, the mysterious origin of fate is a power beyond the gods. Fate implies the primeval, tripartite division of the world that Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades effected in deposing their father, Cronus, for its dominion. Zeus took the Air and the Sky, Poseidon the Waters, and Hades the Underworld, the land of the dead—yet they share dominion of the Earth. Despite the earthly powers of the Olympic gods, only the Three Fates set the destiny of Man.
The poem dates to the archaic period of Classical Antiquity. Scholarly consensus mostly places it in the 8th century BC, although some favour a 7th-century date. Herodotus placed Homer at approximately 400 years before his own time, which would place Homer at circa 850 BC.
The historical backdrop of the poem is the time of the Late Bronze Age collapse, in the early 12th century BC. Homer is thus separated from his subject matter by about 400 years, the period known as the Greek Dark Ages. Intense scholarly debate has surrounded the question of which portions of the poem preserve genuine traditions from the Mycenaean period. The Catalogue of Ships in particular has the striking feature that its geography does not portray Greece in the Iron Age, the time of Homer, but as it was before the Dorian invasion.
The title Ἰλιάς "Ilias" (genitive Ἰλιάδος "Iliados") is elliptic for ἡ ποίησις Ἰλιάς "he poiesis Ilias", meaning "the Trojan poem". Ἰλιάς, "of Troy", is the specifically feminine adjective form from Ἴλιον, "Troy"; the masculine adjective form would be Ἰλιακός or Ἴλιος.[29] It is used by Herodotus.[30]
Venetus A, copied in the 10th century AD, is the oldest fully extant manuscript of the Iliad.[31] The editio princeps dates to 1488, printed by Demetrius Chalcondyles in Florence.
In antiquity, the Greeks applied the Iliad and the Odyssey as the bases of pedagogy. Literature was central to the educational-cultural function of the itinerant rhapsode, who composed consistent epic poems from memory and improvisation, and disseminated them, via song and chant, in his travels and at the Panathenaic Festival of athletics, music, poetics, and sacrifice, celebrating Athena's birthday.[32]
Originally, Classical scholars treated the Iliad and the Odyssey as written poetry, and Homer as a writer. Yet, by the 1920s, Milman Parry (1902–1935) had launched a movement claiming otherwise. His investigation of the oral Homeric style—"stock epithets" and "reiteration" (words, phrases, stanzas) —established that these formulae were artifacts of oral tradition easily applied to an hexametric line. A two-word stock epithet (e.g. "resourceful Odysseus") reiteration may complement a character name by filling a half-line, thus, freeing the poet to compose a half-line of "original" formulaic text to complete his meaning.[33] In Yugoslavia, Parry and his assistant, Albert Lord (1912–1991), studied the oral-formulaic composition of Serbian oral poetry, yielding the Parry/Lord thesis that established oral tradition studies, later developed by Eric Havelock, Marshall McLuhan, Walter Ong, and Gregory Nagy.
In The Singer of Tales (1960), Lord presents likenesses between the tragedies of the Greek Patroclus, in the Iliad, and of the Sumerian Enkidu, in the Epic of Gilgamesh, and claims to refute, with "careful analysis of the repetition of thematic patterns", that the Patroclus storyline upsets Homer's established compositional formulae of "wrath, bride-stealing, and rescue"; thus, stock-phrase reiteration does not restrict his originality in fitting story to rhyme.[34]  [35] Likewise, in The Arming Motif, Prof. James Armstrong reports that the poem's formulae yield richer meaning because the "arming motif" diction—describing Achilles, Agamemnon, Paris, and Patroclus—serves to "heighten the importance of ... an impressive moment", thus, "[reiteration] creates an atmosphere of smoothness", wherein, Homer distinguishes Patroclus from Achilles, and foreshadows the former's death with positive and negative turns of phrase.[36]  [37]
In the Iliad, occasional syntactic inconsistency may be an oral tradition effect—for example, Aphrodite is "laughter-loving", despite being painfully wounded by Diomedes (Book V, 375); and the divine representations may mix Mycenaean and Greek Dark Age (ca. 1150–800 BC) mythologies, parallelling the hereditary basileis nobles (lower social rank rulers) with minor deities, such as Scamander, et al.[38]
Despite Mycenae and Troy being maritime powers, the Iliad features no sea battles.[39] So, the Trojan shipwright (of the ship that transported Helen to Troy), Phereclus, fights afoot, as an infantryman.[40] The battle dress and armour of hero and soldier are well-described. They enter battle in chariots, launching javelins into the enemy formations, then dismount—for hand-to-hand combat with yet more javelin throwing, rock throwing, and if necessary hand to hand sword and a shoulder-borne hoplon (shield) fighting.[41] Ajax the Greater, son of Telamon, sports a large, rectangular shield (σάκος, sakos) with which he protects himself and Teucer, his brother:
Ajax's cumbersome shield is more suitable for defence than for offence, while his cousin, Achilles, sports a large, rounded, octagonal shield that he successfully deploys along with his spear against the Trojans:
In describing infantry combat, Homer names the phalanx formation,[42] but most scholars do not believe the historical Trojan War was so fought.[43] In the Bronze Age, the chariot was the main battle transport-weapon (e.g. the Battle of Kadesh). The available evidence, from the Dendra armour and the Pylos Palace paintings, indicate the Mycenaeans used two-man chariots, with a long-spear-armed principal rider, unlike the three-man Hittite chariots with short-spear-armed riders, and unlike the arrow-armed Egyptian and Assyrian two-man chariots. Nestor spearheads his troops with chariots; he advises them:
Although Homer's depictions are graphic, it can be seen in the very end that victory in war is a far more somber occasion, where all that is lost becomes apparent. On the other hand, the funeral games are lively, for the dead man's life is celebrated. This overall depiction of war runs contrary to many other[citation needed] ancient Greek depictions, where war is an aspiration for greater glory.
While the Homeric poems (the Iliad in particular) were not necessarily revered scripture of the ancient Greeks, they were most certainly seen as guides that were important to the intellectual understanding of any educated Greek citizen. This is evidenced by the fact that in the late fifth century BC, "it was the sign of a man of standing to be able to recite the Iliad and Odyssey by heart."[44] Moreover, it can be argued that the warfare shown in the Iliad, and the way in which it was depicted, had a profound and very traceable effect on Greek warfare in general. In particular, the effect of epic literature can be broken down into three categories: tactics, ideology, and the mindset of commanders. In order to discern these effects, it is necessary to take a look at a few examples from each of these categories.
Much of the detailed fighting in the Iliad is done by the heroes in an orderly, one-on-one fashion. Much like the Odyssey, there is even a set ritual which must be observed in each of these conflicts. For example, a major hero may encounter a lesser hero from the opposing side, in which case the minor hero is introduced, threats may be exchanged, and then the minor hero is slain. The victor often strips the body of its armor and military accoutrements.[45] Here is an example of this ritual and this type of one-on-one combat in the Iliad:
There Telamonian Ajax struck down the son of Anthemion, Simoeisios in his stripling's beauty, whom once his mother descending from Ida bore beside the banks of Simoeis when she had followed her father and mother to tend the sheepflocks. Therefore they called him Simoeisios; but he could not render again the care of his dear parents; he was short-lived, beaten down beneath the spear of high-hearted Ajax, who struck him as he first came forward beside the nipple of the right breast, and the bronze spearhead drove clean through the shoulder.[46]
The biggest issue in reconciling the connection between the epic fighting of the Iliad and later Greek warfare is the phalanx, or hoplite, warfare seen in Greek history well after Homer's Iliad. While there are discussions of soldiers arrayed in semblances of the phalanx throughout the Iliad, the focus of the poem on the heroic fighting, as mentioned above, would seem to contradict the tactics of the phalanx. However, the phalanx did have its heroic aspects. The masculine one-on-one fighting of epic is manifested in phalanx fighting on the emphasis of holding one's position in formation. This replaces the singular heroic competition found in the Iliad.[47]
One example of this is the Spartan tale of 300 picked men fighting against 300 picked Argives. In this battle of champions, only two men are left standing for the Argives and one for the Spartans. Othryades, the remaining Spartan, goes back to stand in his formation with mortal wounds while the remaining two Argives go back to Argos to report their victory. Thus, the Spartans claimed this as a victory, as their last man displayed the ultimate feat of bravery by maintaining his position in the phalanx.[48]
In terms of the ideology of commanders in later Greek history, the Iliad has an interesting effect. The Iliad expresses a definite disdain for tactical trickery, when Hector says, before he challenges the great Ajax:
I know how to storm my way into the struggle of flying horses; I know how to tread the measures on the grim floor of the war god. Yet great as you are I would not strike you by stealth, watching
However, despite examples of disdain for this tactical trickery, there is reason to believe that the Iliad, as well as later Greek warfare, endorsed tactical genius on the part of their commanders. For example, there are multiple passages in the Iliad with commanders such as Agamemnon or Nestor discussing the arraying of troops so as to gain an advantage. Indeed, the Trojan War is won by a notorious example of Greek guile in the Trojan Horse. This is even later referred to by Homer in the Odyssey. The connection, in this case, between guileful tactics of the Greeks in the Iliad and those of the later Greeks is not a difficult one to find. Spartan commanders, often seen as the pinnacle of Greek military prowess, were known for their tactical trickery, and, for them, this was a feat to be desired in a commander. Indeed, this type of leadership was the standard advice of Greek tactical writers.[50]
Ultimately, while Homeric (or epic) fighting is certainly not completely replicated in later Greek warfare, many of its ideals, tactics, and instruction are.[51]
Hans van Wees argues that the period that the descriptions of warfare relate can be pinned down fairly specifically—to the first half of the 7th century BC.[52]
The Iliad was a standard work of great importance already in Classical Greece and remained so throughout the Hellenistic and Byzantine periods. It made its return to Italy and Western Europe beginning in the 15th century, primarily through translations into Latin and the vernacular languages. Prior to this reintroduction, a shortened Latin version of the poem, known as the Ilias Latina, was very widely studied and read as a basic school text. The West, however, had tended to look at Homer as a liar as they believed they possessed much more down to earth and realistic eyewitness accounts of the Trojan War written by Dares and Dictys Cretensis who were supposedly present at the events.
These late antique forged accounts formed the basis of several eminently popular medieval chivalric romances, most notably those of Benoit de Sainte-Maure and Guido delle Colonne. These in turn spawned many others in various European languages, such as the first printed English book, the 1473 Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye. Other accounts read in the Middle Ages were antique Latin retellings such as the Excidium Troiae and works in the vernaculars such as the Icelandic Troy Saga. Even without Homer, the Trojan War story had remained central to Western European medieval literary culture and its sense of identity. Most nations and several royal houses traced their origins to heroes at the Trojan War. Britain was supposedly settled by the Trojan Brutus, for instance.
Subjects from the Trojan War were a favourite among ancient Greek dramatists. Aeschylus' trilogy, the Oresteia, comprising Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides, follows the story of Agamemnon after his return from the war.
Homer also came to be of great influence in European culture with the resurgence of interest in Greek antiquity during the Renaissance, and it remains the first and most influential work of the Western canon.
William Shakespeare used the plot of the Iliad as source material for his play Troilus and Cressida, but focused on a medieval legend, the love story of Troilus, son of King Priam of Troy, and Cressida, daughter of the Trojan soothsayer Calchas. The play, often considered to be a comedy, reverses traditional views on events of the Trojan War and depicts Achilles as a coward, Ajax as a dull, unthinking mercenary, etc.
William Theed the elder made an impressive bronze statue of Thetis as she brought Achilles his new armor forged by Hephaesthus. It has been on display in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City since 2013.
Robert Browning's poem Development discusses his childhood introduction to the matter of the Iliad and his delight in the epic, as well as contemporary debates about its authorship.
Simone Weil wrote the essay The Iliad or the Poem of Force in 1939 shortly after the commencement of World War II. The essay describes how the Iliad demonstrates the way force, exercised to the extreme in war, reduces both victim and aggressor to the level of the slave and the unthinking automaton.[53]
The 1954 Broadway musical The Golden Apple by librettist John Treville Latouche and composer Jerome Moross was freely adapted from the Iliad and the Odyssey, re-setting the action to America's Washington state in the years after the Spanish–American War, with events inspired by the Iliad in Act One and events inspired by the Odyssey in Act Two.
Christa Wolf's 1983 novel Cassandra is a critical engagement with the Iliad. Wolf's narrator is Cassandra, whose thoughts we hear at the moment just before her murder by Clytemnestra in Sparta. Wolf's narrator presents a feminist's view of the war, and of war in general. Cassandra's story is accompanied by four essays which Wolf delivered as the Frankfurter Poetik-Vorlesungen. The essays present Wolf's concerns as a writer and rewriter of this canonical story and show the genesis of the novel through Wolf's own readings and in a trip she took to Greece.
David Melnick's Men in Aida (cf. μῆνιν ἄειδε) (1983) is a postmodern homophonic translation of Book One into a farcical bathhouse scenario, preserving the sounds but not the meaning of the original.
An epic science fiction adaptation/tribute by acclaimed author Dan Simmons titled Ilium was released in 2003. The novel received a Locus Award for best science fiction novel of 2003.
A loose film adaptation of the Iliad, Troy, was released in 2004. Though the film received mixed reviews, it was a commercial success, particularly in international sales. It grossed $133 million in the United States and $497 million worldwide, placing it in the 88th top-grossing movies of all time.[54]
Age of Bronze is an American comics series by writer/artist Eric Shanower retelling the legend of the Trojan War. It began in 1998 and is published by Image Comics.[55]  [56]  [57]
Published October 2011,[58]  Alice Oswald's sixth collection, Memorial, is based on the Iliad but departs from the narrative form of the Iliad to focus on, and so commemorate, the individually-named characters whose deaths are mentioned in that poem.[59]  [60]  [61] Later in October 2011, Memorial was shortlisted for the T. S. Eliot Prize,[62] but in December 2011, Oswald withdrew the book from the shortlist,[63]  [64] citing concerns about the ethics of the prize's sponsors.[65]
George Chapman published his translation of the Iliad, in instalments, beginning in 1598, published in "fourteeners", a long-line ballad metre that "has room for all of Homer's figures of speech and plenty of new ones, as well as explanations in parentheses. At its best, as in Achilles' rejection of the embassy in Iliad Nine; it has great rhetorical power".[66] It quickly established itself as a classic in English poetry. In the preface to his own translation, Pope praises "the daring fiery spirit" of Chapman's rendering, which is "something like what one might imagine Homer, himself, would have writ before he arrived at years of discretion".
John Keats praised Chapman in the sonnet On First Looking into Chapman's Homer (1816). John Ogilby's mid-seventeenth-century translation is among the early annotated editions; Alexander Pope's 1715 translation, in heroic couplet, is "The classic translation that was built on all the preceding versions",[67] and, like Chapman's, it is a major poetic work in its own right. William Cowper's Miltonic, blank verse 1791 edition is highly regarded for its greater fidelity to the Greek than either the Chapman or the Pope versions: "I have omitted nothing; I have invented nothing", Cowper says in prefacing his translation.
In the lectures On Translating Homer (1861), Matthew Arnold addresses the matters of translation and interpretation in rendering the Iliad to English; commenting upon the versions contemporarily available in 1861, he identifies the four essential poetic qualities of Homer to which the translator must do justice:
[i] that he is eminently rapid; [ii] that he is eminently plain and direct, both in the evolution of his thought and in the expression of it, that is, both in his syntax and in his words; [iii] that he is eminently plain and direct in the substance of his thought, that is, in his matter and ideas; and, finally, [iv] that he is eminently noble.
After a discussion of the metres employed by previous translators, Arnold argues for a poetical dialect hexameter translation of the Iliad, like the original. "Laborious as this meter was, there were at least half a dozen attempts to translate the entire Iliad or Odyssey in hexameters; the last in 1945. Perhaps the most fluent of them was by J. Henry Dart [1862] in response to Arnold".[68] In 1870, the American poet William Cullen Bryant published a blank verse version, that Van Wyck Brooks describes as "simple, faithful".
Since 1950, there have been several English translations. Richmond Lattimore's version (1951) is "a free six-beat" line-for-line rendering that explicitly eschews "poetical dialect" for "the plain English of today". It is literal, unlike older verse renderings. Robert Fitzgerald's version (Oxford World's Classics, 1974) strives to situate the Iliad in the musical forms of English poetry. His forceful version is freer, with shorter lines that increase the sense of swiftness and energy. Robert Fagles (Penguin Classics, 1990) and Stanley Lombardo (1997) are bolder than Lattimore in adding dramatic significance to Homer's conventional and formulaic language. Barry B. Powell's translation (Oxford University Press, 2014) renders the Homeric Greek with a simplicity and dignity reminiscent of the original.
There are more than 2000 manuscripts of Homer.[69]  [70] Some of the most notable manuscripts include:

-=-=-SNIPPET:  The Iliad (Ancient Greek u1f38u03bbu03b9u03acu03c2, Ilias) is, together with the Odyssey, one of two ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer, purportedly a blind Ionian poet.
-=-=-TEXT: The Iliad (Ancient Greek Ἰλιάς, Ilias) is, together with the Odyssey, one of two ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer, purportedly a blind Ionian poet. The poem concerns events during the tenth and final year in the siege of the city of Ilion, Troy, by the Greeks (during the Trojan War). The names "Ilium" and "Troy" are often used interchangeably in classical literature.
Of the many themes in the Iliad, perhaps the most important is the idea of moral choice. Achilles believes he has two options: He can either live a long, unremarkable life at home or he can die young and gloriously as a mercenary warrior. Military adventuring (that is, pillage and plunder) was a way of life in pre-Homeric times, and the many ruins of thick-walled cities and fortresses in the region give silent testimony to the fear that must have characterized life in the ancient world. Death in battle leads to honor—timae—and glory—kleos—important values of the day, more important than even right and wrong. One of the remarkable things about the Iliad is the way that Achilles, especially in Book 9, both embraces concepts of honor and glory and also rejects them.
Most modern scholars consider the Iliad and the Odyssey to be the oldest literature in the Greek language (though some believe that the works of the poet Hesiod were composed earlier, a belief that some classical Greeks also held). Most scholars date them to the eighth century B.C.E., although a few argue for early or later dating.
The Iliad begins with these lines:
The first word of the Iliad is μῆνιν (mēnin), "rage" or "wrath." This word announces the major theme of the Iliad: The wrath of Achilles. When Agamemnon, the commander of the Greek forces at Troy, dishonors Achilles by taking Briseis, a slave woman given to Achilles as a prize of war, Achilles becomes enraged and withdraws from the fighting for almost all of the story. Without him and his powerful Myrmidon warriors, the Greeks suffer defeat by the Trojans, almost to the point of losing their will to fight. Achilles re-enters the fighting when his dearest friend, Patroclus, is killed by the Trojan prince, Hector. Achilles slaughters many Trojans and kills Hector. In his rage, he then refuses to return Hector's body and instead defiles it. Priam, the father of Hector, ransoms his son's body, and the Iliad ends with the funeral of Hector.
Homer devotes long passages to frank, blow-by-blow descriptions of combat. He gives the names of the fighters, recounts their taunts and battle-cries, and gruesomely details the ways in which they kill and wound one another. Often, the death of a hero only escalates the violence, as the two sides battle for his armor and corpse, or his close companions launch a punitive attack on his killer. The lucky ones are sometimes whisked away by friendly charioteers or the intervention of a god, but Homeric warfare is still some of the most bloody and brutal in literature.
The Iliad has a very strong religious and supernatural element. Both sides in the war are extremely pious, and both have heroes descended from divine beings. They constantly sacrifice to the gods and consult priests and prophets to decide their actions. For their own part, the gods frequently join in battles, both by advising and protecting their favorites and even by participating in combat against humans and other gods.
The Iliad's huge cast of characters connects the Trojan War to many Greek myths, such as Jason and the Argonauts, the Seven Against Thebes, and the Labors of Hercules. Many Greek myths exist in multiple versions, so Homer had some freedom to choose among them to suit his story.
The action of the Iliad covers only a few weeks of the tenth and final year of the Trojan War. It does not cover the background and early years of the war, Paris' abduction of Helen from King Menelaus, nor its end (the death of Achilles and the fall of Troy). Other epic poems, collectively known as the Epic Cycle or cyclic epics, narrated many of these events; these poems only survive in fragments and later descriptions.
As the poem begins, the Greeks have captured Chryseis, the daughter of Apollo's priest, Chryses, and given her as a prize to Agamemnon. In response, Apollo has sent a plague against the Greeks, who compel Agamemnon to restore Chryseis to her father to stop the sickness. In her place, Agamemnon takes Briseis, whom the Achaeans had given to Achilles as a spoil of war. Achilles, the greatest warrior of the age, follows the advice of his goddess mother, Thetis, and withdraws from battle in revenge.
In counterpoint to Achilles' pride and arrogance stands the Trojan prince Hector, son of King Priam, a husband and father who fights to defend his city and his family. With Achilles on the sidelines, Hector leads successful counterattacks against the Greeks, who have built a fortified camp around their ships pulled up on the Trojan beach. The best remaining Greek fighters, including Odysseus, Diomedes, and Ajax, are wounded, and the gods favor the Trojans. Patroclus, impersonating Achilles by wearing his armor, finally leads the Myrmidons back into battle to save the ships from being burned. The death of Patroclus at the hands of Hector brings Achilles back to the war for revenge, and he slays Hector in single combat. Hector's father, King Priam, later comes to Achilles alone (but aided by Hermes) to ransom his son's body, and Achilles is moved to pity; the funeral of Hector ends the poem.
Book 1: Nine years into the war, Agamemnon seizes Briseis, the captive slave girl of Achilles, since he has had to give away his own; Achilles withdraws from the fighting in anger; in Olympus, the gods argue about the outcome of the war
Book 2: Agamemnon pretends to order the Greeks home to test their resolve; Odysseus encourages the Greeks to keep fighting; Catalogue of Ships, Catalogue of Trojans and Allies
Book 3: Paris challenges Menelaus to single combat; Paris is rescued from death by Aphrodite
Book 4: The truce is broken and battle begins
Book 5: Diomedes has an aristeia (a period of supremacy in battle) and wounds Aphrodite and Ares
Book 6: Glaucus and Diomedes greet each other during a truce; Hector returns to Troy and speaks to his wife Andromache
Book 7: Hector battles Ajax
Book 8: The gods withdraw from the battle
Book 9: Agamemnon retreats; his overtures to Achilles are spurned
Book 10: Diomedes and Odysseus go on a spying mission
Book 12: The Greeks retreat to their camp and are besieged by the Trojans
Book 16: Patroclus borrows Achilles' armor, enters battle, kills Sarpedon and then is killed by Hector
Book 17: The armies fight over the body and armor of Patroclus
Book 18: Achilles learns of the death of Patroclus and receives a new suit of armor. The Shield of Achilles is described at length
Book 19: Achilles is reconciled with Agamemnon and enters battle
Book 20: The gods join the battle; Achilles tries to kill Aeneas
Book 21: Achilles does battle with the river Scamander and encounters Hector in front of the Trojan gates
Book 22: Achilles kills Hector and drags his body back to the Greek camp
Book 24: Priam, the King of the Trojans, secretly enters the Greek camp. He begs Achilles for Hector's body. Achilles grants him it, and it is taken away and burned on a pyre
The Iliad contains a sometimes confusingly great number of characters. The latter half of the second book (often called the Catalogue of Ships) is devoted entirely to listing the various commanders. Many of the battle scenes in the Iliad feature bit characters who are quickly slain.
Agamemnon (Αγαμέμνων), King of Mycenae, supreme commander of the Achaean armies whose actions provoke the feud with Achilles; brother of King Menelaus
Odysseus (Οδυσσεύς), another warrior-king, famed for his cunning, who is the main character of another (roughly equally ancient) epic, the Odyssey
Calchas (Κάλχας), a powerful Greek prophet and omen reader, who guided the Greeks through the war with his predictions.
Priam (Πρίαμος), king of the Trojans, too old to take part in the fighting; many of the Trojan commanders are his fifty sons
Hector (Έκτωρ), firstborn son of King Priam, leader of the Trojan and allied armies and heir apparent to the throne of Troy
Paris (Πάρις), Trojan prince and Hector's brother, also called Alexander; his abduction of Helen is the cause of the war. He was supposed to be killed as a baby because his sister Cassandra foresaw that he would cause the destruction of Troy. Raised by a shepherd.
Aeneas (Αινείας), cousin of Hector and his principal lieutenant, son of Aphrodite, the only major Trojan figure to survive the war. Held by later tradition to be the forefather of the founders of Rome.
Glaucus and Sarpedon, leaders of the Lycian forces allied to the Trojan cause
Helen (Ελένη), former Queen of Sparta and wife of Menelaus, now espoused to Paris
Cassandra, daughter of Priam, prophetess, first courted and then cursed by Apollo. As her punishment for offending him, she accurately foresees the fate of Troy, including her own death and the deaths of her entire family, but is not believed.
The Olympian deities, principally Zeus, Hera, Apollo, Hades, Aphrodite, Ares, Athena, Hermes, and Poseidon, as well as the lesser figures Eris, Thetis, and Proteus appear in the Iliad as advisers to and manipulators of the human characters. All except Zeus become personally involved in the fighting at one point or another.
The poem is written in dactylic hexameter. The Iliad comprises 15,693 lines of verse. Later Greeks divided it into twenty-four books, or scrolls, and this convention has lasted to the present day with little change.
The Iliad and the Odyssey were considered by Greeks of the classical age, and later, as the most important works in Ancient Greek literature, and were the basis of Greek pedagogy in antiquity. As the center of the rhapsode's repertoire, their recitation was a central part of Greek religious festivals. The book would be spoken or sung all night (modern readings last around 14 hours), with audiences coming and going for parts they particularly enjoyed.
Throughout much of their history, scholars of the written word treated the Iliad and Odyssey as literary poems, and Homer as a writer much like themselves. However, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, scholars began to question this assumption. Milman Parry, a classical scholar, was intrigued by peculiar features of Homeric style: In particular, the stock epithets and the often extensive repetition of words, phrase, and even whole chunks of text. He argued that these features were artifacts of oral composition. The poet employs stock phrases because of the ease with which they could be applied to a hexameter line. Taking this theory, Parry traveled in Yugoslavia, studying the local oral poetry. In his research, he observed oral poets employing stock phrases and repetition to assist with the challenge of composing a poem orally and improvisationally.
Subjects from the Trojan War were a favorite among ancient Greek dramatists. Aeschylus' trilogy, the Oresteia, comprising Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides, follows the story of Agamemnon after his return from the war.
Christa Wolf's 1983 novel, Kassandra, is a critical engagement with the stuff of the Iliad. Wolf's narrator is Cassandra, whose thoughts are heard at the moment just before her murder by Clytemnestra in Sparta. Wolf's narrator presents a feminist's view of the war, and of war in general. Cassandra's story is accompanied by four essays which Wolf delivered as the Frankfurter Poetik-Vorlesungen. The essays present Wolf's concerns as a writer and rewriter of this canonical story and show the genesis of the novel through Wolf's own readings and a trip she took to Greece.
An epic science fiction adaptation/tribute by acclaimed author Dan Simmons, titled Ilium, was released in 2003. The novel received a Locus Award for best science fiction novel of 2003.
The Iliad has been translated into English for centuries. George Chapman did a translation in the sixteenth century which John Keats praised in his sonnet, On First Looking into Chapman's Homer and Alexander Pope did another one in rhymed pentameter. Poet William Cowper's 1791 version in forceful Miltonic blank verse is highly regarded by those who manage to find a copy. In his lectures, On Translating Homer, Matthew Arnold commented on the problems of translating the Iliad and on the major translations available in 1861. In 1870, American poet William Cullen Bryant published a "simple, faithful" (Van Wyck Brooks) version in blank verse.
There are several twentieth century English translations. Richmond Lattimore's version attempts to reproduce, line for line, the rhythm and phrasing of the original poem. Robert Fitzgerald has striven to situate the Iliad in the musical forms of English poetry. Robert Fagles and Stanley Lombardo both follow the Greek closely but are bolder in adding dramatic significance to conventional and formulaic Homeric language. Lombardo has chosen an American idiom that is much more colloquial than the other translations.
This is a partial list of translations into English of Homer's Iliad.

I don't drink or smoke, so when I want to wind down after a long day, feel-good films are my vice: Lifetime movies, anything by Tyler Perry and anything with J Lo. Naturally, when I found out that she was co-producing and starring in a new flick, I looked forward to it. Lopez's roles are usually light-hearted and fun if not taken too seriously, and since the screenplay was written by a woman, and Lopez is unafraid to publicly identify as a feminist, I was interested in seeing what she would produce. But rather than feeling relaxed, or even just grateful that my life is monumentally easier than the protagonist's -- the way I usually feel after watching similar movies -- I was left feeling disturbed, uncomfortable and frankly, a little irritated. 
I'd like to start off by stressing that I'm not delusional; as an enjoyer of light, fluffy plot lines, nonsensical rom-coms, hilarious horror and dramatically over-the-top Lifetime flicks, I was ready to overlook a lot because I knew what I was signing up for. Our anti-hero has a painfully obvious Oedipus complex? Love it. The main character's a "classics" teacher who's newest yet oldest student just gave her a "first edition" of The Iliad ? LOL. She teaches juniors, yet the new kid is pushing 20 (and looks more like 30)? No problem. She never bothers to alert the police even though she's "not scared" because "who are they going to believe?" Weird, but OK! 
What I couldn't reconcile was the film's depiction of Kristin Chenoweth's character, who plays Lopez's confidante, BFF and superior. Throughout, the audience is sent clear signals about the vast differences between Vicky (played by Kristin) and Claire (J Lo). Vicky is a "bad girl" -- she's authoritative, she doesn't take shit,and she makes the inexcusable mistake of "trying" to be sexy. In fact, she shamelessly asserts her sexuality. She's a femme fatale, and she must be severely punished for her transgressions. By contrast, Claire is "good": she dresses modestly, she wears spectacles and reads "classics," she wants to forgive her philandering husband and she initially tries to resist the forceful come-ons of the man/boy she's branded as some sort of buff Byronic hero. "Nice" or "good girls," with their sexually submissive attitudes and eternal fountain of forgiveness for their male counterparts (who can't be held responsible for their lusty desires, after all) can in turn, be absolved for their sins. "Bad girls," on the other hand, must pay. 
Claire is presented to the audience as more desirable than Vicky. When the Homer-quoting Heathcliff wannabe named Noah comments on Claire's shoes, she confesses that they're actually Vicky's. He announces his approval. The shoes are for women who trying to be sexy (how awful!), and Claire doesn't need to try. Because her marriage is on the rocks, Claire is more flattered than put off by this chauvinistic remark. 
Then, when Claire comes over a few days later, he practically forces himself on her, as she says "no" what seems like hundreds of times. But she gives in; after all, how could she resist his manly charms? Although the sex looks more stilted than steamy, apparently Noah was satisfied because the next morning, he acts creepily delusional. The whole scene was confusing to me because I wasn't sure who would be turned on by watching it. As a woman, I felt uneasy with how Noah refused to take "no" for an answer and again brushed off Claire's misgivings in the morning. If I was male, I'd be rolling my eyes at all the close-ups on our hunky Heathcliff's torso, while Lopez coyly used her blanket to avoid full-frontal. So far, the movie has sent a pretty clear message to viewers that men are by nature sexual and aggressive, and women should relent, know their place and not "try too hard." 
But no, the movie isn't done beating its point into the ground, literally. Due to his inability to comprehend rejection, Noah's behaviour becomes increasingly troubling. He tampers with the brakes in Claire's husband's car. He almost kills a skater boy for taunting Claire's son (although he doesn't appear to particularly care for her son -- sleeping with his hardware-store hottie love interest, trying to off his father and later on trying to kill him -- so Noah's motive for this is unclear). He threatens to expose Claire for bedding a student. The film tries to sell Noah to us as a "tortured soul," depicting him as the pinnacle of masculinity. Sure, he gets his comeuppance, but not in the way that Vicky does. 
Vicky, the only woman who openly stands up to Noah, is humiliated by him. She tries to defend skater boy, but Noah throws her to the ground with a flick of the wrist. It's only when a male teacher interferes that Noah is able to be restrained. Later on in Vicky's office, Noah calls her a "dried-up dirty fucking cunt," and the movie doesn't even let her slap him in retaliation. Vicky plots with Claire to help her recover and destroy what I'm sure would've been the world's most awkward sex tape, but Noah is on to her, sneaking into her house and tying her up, finally taming the temptress. The audience doesn't see Vicky again until Claire discovers her as nothing more than a bound, bloodied corpse. 
Really? Really, The Boy Next Door ? Did this character deserve to die for daring to be unwed in her 40s, walking around in high heels and trying to take down psychopaths? Did she have to be presented as inferior to Noah in every way, being overpowered and outsmarted by him? 
The messages that this movie sends to both its male and female viewers are problematic and dangerous. I usually enjoy these types of films because they at least attempt to make an uplifting point towards the end, even that message isn't much more than "be glad you aren't them!" But I can't think of anything good that this movie is promoting.

-=-=-TEXT: Iliad, (Song of Ilion; Song of Ilium) this epic Homeric poem tells the story of the Trojan War and the battle of Troy (Ilium), one of the most important and well-known events in Greek mythology when the gods still visited mortals. It tells of Achilles, leader of the Achaeans and his great wrath towards King Agamemnon, leader of the Greeks. Narrated by one informed by the Muses, it includes other such important Achaean and Trojan figures as Zeus, Patroclus, Diomed, Ajax, Menelaus, Hector, Hecuba, Helen, Paris, and Aeneas. Iliad is a glorification of war and the bravery of Achilles, demi-god and great military warrior.
A war started over a single fruit. This is where the tale of the Iliad began. It developed over time to become one of the great epics of our society, one that many people all over the world have come to like, sympathizing for each of the characters. Homer's creative use of the Greek language makes it far more interesting, his lengthy descriptions give the mind something to picture. Its as if you were there, standing next to each of the main warriors as these things happened to them. Homeric similes make the picture even more vivid, comparing the Greek and Trojan warriors to everything from deities to boars. Not only is this a tale of war, but the fights that occur between men when their pride gets hurt. How every man has that one thing he will always be mad about. The characters may seem devoid of human emotions, but eventually develop individual personalities. In only a few parts does it seem like only a listing, that the deaths that occur are not actually real people. You can relate to the main characters, sympathize or even hate them as you go through. The Greek gods are an extreme part of this tale. The war started because of gods, and they continued interfering all through the story. Even such things as sleep and ruin are characterized as being actual deities, showing us a side of Greek culture that not many knew of. An overlying theme in this book is based off of the Greek word aritei. This is the one thing every Greek warrior thrived for. It was honor. This honor could be found in battling a more experienced opponent than yourself, even if it did end in your death. Killing a man lower in rank, killing him after promising something to him, or defacing an enemy after his death could all result in the loss of aritei, immediately resulting in the lowering of one's honor. The Iliad is truly entertaining, whether you are reading it for the entertainment or historical value. So please, go, enjoy this amazing story of pride, honor, love, and war.--Submitted by Jessi Kluvich

Hi, can anyone help me to identify this translation of The Iliad (It has become something of an obsession for me now):    "Sing the wrath, O Goddess, the baleful wrath of Achilles son of Pelus, that laid on the Achaens ten thousand sorrows, and sent away goodly souls of heroes to Hades, and themselves it gave to dogs and all the birds; and the counsel of Zeus was fulfilled, from the day when first Atreides, king of men, and the divine Achilles quarrelled and stood apart. Who among the gods set them twain to fight?"    I've taken it from the first chapter of East and West by C. Northcote Parkinson, where the author describes it as "the opening lines of The Iliad".     In the bibliography at the end of the book, he has "Homer, The Iliad, translated by E.V.Rieu, Penguinn Classics, 1950.     So I got a copy of that exact book, but this it not it. This book begins "The Wrath of Achilles is my theme....". Really it's a much plainer version of that verse, without that kind of "old-world" sound to it (excuse my lame description of how the text sounds to me!)    I have googled some phrases from the quote, and the closest I've found is a version by Walter Leaf, Andrew Lang and Ernest Myers, 1873, but it is still significantly different.     I am beginning to think Parkinson made this up, i.e. paraphrased from several translations he had read, and then just looked up the most "current" translation for his bibliography, which would have been Rieu's. But there is something about the particular language that I really like, and I'd really like to find if it's an existing translation.     Any ideas? Thanks in advance!

The Iliad and Odyssey were composed in a culture in which art played a central role. The poems themselves refer to artistic productions, most famously the elaborately decorated shield which Hephaistos makes for Achilles in Iliad 18. In addition, many of the heroes and episodes described in the Homeric poems became popular subjects for sculpture and painting. Here is a chart listing the major periods of Greek art, along with examples from two of the periods and descriptions of some of the major features as they relate to the Homeric poems. More examples will be added as they become available.
1. Mycenaean period (1600-1200)
This is the time contemporary to the "historical" events described in the Iliad and Odyssey.
 2. Proto-Geometric and Geometric periods (1050-750)
 Dipylon Amphora (Saskia JGCO330.GIF)
This amphora, now in the Athens National Museum, dates to about 760 BC, the time when the Iliad and Odyssey were taking shape. This piece is typical of large (5 foot tall) geometric amphorae which were used as tomb markers in the cemeteries just outside Athens. Most of the vase is decorated with intricate geometric designs, except for two bands of stylized animals on the neck, and the central mourning scene between the two handles. The central scene depicts the part of a Greek funeral known as the prothesis, or laying out of the body. The corpse is shown lying on a funeral bed, surrounded by mourners who are lamenting and tearing out their hair. The scene may depict a contemporary funeral, or that of a hero from the mythic past.
 The next two images show details from the amphora.
 3. Orientalizing period (720-620)
 4. Archaic period (620-480)
 Achilles and Ajax Playing a Board Game.
This Attic black figure vase in the Vatican Museum was produced by Exekias in Athens about 530 BC. It depicts Achilles and Ajax playing a board game during a lull in the fighting around Troy.
5. Classical period (480-323)
 Archaeologists have done much in the last century to increase our knowledge about a number of sites mentioned in the Iliad and Odyssey. Useful accounts of what we know about some of these sites are provided by the Perseus Project. Perseus provides brief geographical and physical descriptions, lists modern archaeological excavations done at the sites, notes the architectural remains, and gives (for some sites) a site plan with arrows that you can "click" on to see views from specific locations at the sites. It is thus possible to "walk around" the remains of Agamemnon's Mycenae or Nestor's Pylos on your own! Here is a list of the sites from Perseus which are of most interest to reader's of Homer.
 No one knows. Even the ancient Greeks were not able to agree about when and where Homer lived. One popular account was that he was born some time in the 8th century BC in Smyrna in Asia Minor, lived on the island of Chios, and died on the small island of Ios. Greek writers also claimed that he was blind, that his real name was Melesigines, and that his father was the river Meles and his mother a nymph named Kretheis.  
Though they could not agree about the details of his life, ancient Greeks did not doubt that there was a poet named Homer who had written the Iliad, the Odyssey, and possibly a number of other poems. Many modern scholars dispute even this. Scholars in the last two hundred years have established that the Iliad and Odyssey are products of a long oral tradition which became fixed sometime in the eighth century BC. How exactly the poems took their final shape (Was it the work of one person or several? Did the process involve writing?) is still a matter of speculation.
2.  Is the Iliad historically accurate?
 It depends on what you mean by "historically accurate." Modern historians generally agree that the Iliad reflects a set of historical events, but disagree about the relationship of the Iliad to those events. Most historians accept that at some point around 1250-1200 BC the city of Troy was destroyed by a raiding party from the Greek mainland. Most also believe that the poem, while probably wrong in most of its historical details, reflects some historical realities from the Late Bronze Age and Dark Ages (1200 - 900 BC) which are consistent with the archaeological record.
3.  How do you keep all of the names of people, places, and gods straight?
 It is hard at first. There is a good glossary in the back of the Lattimore translation, and is also helpful to keep your own list of people who occur more than once.

-=-=-TITLE:  SparkNotes: The Iliad : Plot Overview
-=-=-SNIPPET:  s The Iliad. This free synopsis covers all the crucial plot points of The Iliad., u
-=-=-TEXT: Nine years after the start of the Trojan War, the Greek (“Achaean”) army sacks Chryse, a town allied with Troy. During the battle, the Achaeans capture a pair of beautiful maidens, Chryseis and Briseis. Agamemnon, the leader of the Achaean forces, takes Chryseis as his prize, and Achilles, the Achaeans’ greatest warrior, claims Briseis. Chryseis’s father, Chryses, who serves as a priest of the god Apollo, offers an enormous ransom in return for his daughter, but Agamemnon refuses to give Chryseis back. Chryses then prays to Apollo, who sends a plague upon the Achaean camp. 
After many Achaeans die, Agamemnon consults the prophet Calchas to determine the cause of the plague. When he learns that Chryseis is the cause, he reluctantly gives her up but then demands Briseis from Achilles as compensation. Furious at this insult, Achilles returns to his tent in the army camp and refuses to fight in the war any longer. He vengefully yearns to see the Achaeans destroyed and asks his mother, the sea-nymph Thetis, to enlist the services of Zeus, king of the gods, toward this end. The Trojan and Achaean sides have declared a cease-fire with each other, but now the Trojans breach the treaty and Zeus comes to their aid.
With Zeus supporting the Trojans and Achilles refusing to fight, the Achaeans suffer great losses. Several days of fierce conflict ensue, including duels between Paris and Menelaus and between Hector and Ajax. The Achaeans make no progress; even the heroism of the great Achaean warrior Diomedes proves fruitless. The Trojans push the Achaeans back, forcing them to take refuge behind the ramparts that protect their ships. The Achaeans begin to nurture some hope for the future when a nighttime reconnaissance mission by Diomedes and Odysseus yields information about the Trojans’ plans, but the next day brings disaster. Several Achaean commanders become wounded, and the Trojans break through the Achaean ramparts. They advance all the way up to the boundary of the Achaean camp and set fire to one of the ships. Defeat seems imminent, because without the ships, the army will be stranded at Troy and almost certainly destroyed.
Concerned for his comrades but still too proud to help them himself, Achilles agrees to a plan proposed by Nestor that will allow his beloved friend Patroclus to take his place in battle, wearing his armor. Patroclus is a fine warrior, and his presence on the battlefield helps the Achaeans push the Trojans away from the ships and back to the city walls. But the counterattack soon falters. Apollo knocks Patroclus’s armor to the ground, and Hector slays him. Fighting then breaks out as both sides try to lay claim to the body and armor. Hector ends up with the armor, but the Achaeans, thanks to a courageous effort by Menelaus and others, manage to bring the body back to their camp. When Achilles discovers that Hector has killed Patroclus, he fills with such grief and rage that he agrees to reconcile with Agamemnon and rejoin the battle. Thetis goes to Mount Olympus and persuades the god Hephaestus to forge Achilles a new suit of armor, which she presents to him the next morning. Achilles then rides out to battle at the head of the Achaean army.
Meanwhile, Hector, not expecting Achilles to rejoin the battle, has ordered his men to camp outside the walls of Troy. But when the Trojan army glimpses Achilles, it flees in terror back behind the city walls. Achilles cuts down every Trojan he sees. Strengthened by his rage, he even fights the god of the river Xanthus, who is angered that Achilles has caused so many corpses to fall into his streams. Finally, Achilles confronts Hector outside the walls of Troy. Ashamed at the poor advice that he gave his comrades, Hector refuses to flee inside the city with them. Achilles chases him around the city’s periphery three times, but the goddess Athena finally tricks Hector into turning around and fighting Achilles. In a dramatic duel, Achilles kills Hector. He then lashes the body to the back of his chariot and drags it across the battlefield to the Achaean camp. Upon Achilles’ arrival, the triumphant Achaeans celebrate Patroclus’s funeral with a long series of athletic games in his honor. Each day for the next nine days, Achilles drags Hector’s body in circles around Patroclus’s funeral bier.
At last, the gods agree that Hector deserves a proper burial. Zeus sends the god Hermes to escort King Priam, Hector’s father and the ruler of Troy, into the Achaean camp. Priam tearfully pleads with Achilles to take pity on a father bereft of his son and return Hector’s body. He invokes the memory of Achilles’ own father, Peleus. Deeply moved, Achilles finally relents and returns Hector’s corpse to the Trojans. Both sides agree to a temporary truce, and Hector receives a hero’s funeral.
In the summary for book 4 it says, " Zeus argues that Menelaus has won the duel," while in the quiz the "correct" answer for the person who believes that Paris won the duel is Zeus. This is a direct contradiction and should be rectified.
I must disagree with Hektor's commentary above.
He did flee. THREE times... The only moment when he stands and fights is when he thinks he has a buddy by his side to back him up.
 Sorry, but that is cowardice (and he is the GREATEST of the Trojans... just saying...) He is a coward by the end of the book, not so different from Paris.

  Sing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought countless  ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did it send hurrying down to  Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures, for so  were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on which the son of Atreus,  king of men, and great Achilles, first fell out with one  another.  
And which of the gods was it that set them on to quarrel? It was  the son of Jove and Leto; for he was angry with the king and sent a pestilence  upon the host to plague the people, because the son of Atreus had dishonoured  Chryses his priest. Now Chryses had come to the ships of the Achaeans to  free his daughter, and had brought with him a great ransom: moreover he  bore in his hand the sceptre of Apollo wreathed with a suppliant's wreath  and he besought the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus, who  were their chiefs.  
"Sons of Atreus," he cried, "and all other Achaeans, may the gods  who dwell in Olympus grant you to sack the city of Priam, and to reach  your homes in safety; but free my daughter, and accept a ransom for her,  in reverence to Apollo, son of Jove."  
On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting  the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon,  who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. "Old man," said he,  "let me not find you tarrying about our ships, nor yet coming hereafter.  Your sceptre of the god and your wreath shall profit you nothing. I will  not free her. She shall grow old in my house at Argos far from her own  home, busying herself with her loom and visiting my couch; so go, and do  not provoke me or it shall be the worse for you."  
The old man feared him and obeyed. Not a word he spoke, but went  by the shore of the sounding sea and prayed apart to King Apollo whom lovely  Leto had borne. "Hear me," he cried, "O god of the silver bow, that protectest  Chryse and holy Cilla and rulest Tenedos with thy might, hear me oh thou  of Sminthe. If I have ever decked your temple with garlands, or burned  your thigh-bones in fat of bulls or goats, grant my prayer, and let your  arrows avenge these my tears upon the Danaans."  
Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. He came down furious  from the summits of Olympus, with his bow and his quiver upon his shoulder,  and the arrows rattled on his back with the rage that trembled within him.  He sat himself down away from the ships with a face as dark as night, and  his silver bow rang death as he shot his arrow in the midst of them. First  he smote their mules and their hounds, but presently he aimed his shafts  at the people themselves, and all day long the pyres of the dead were  burning.  
For nine whole days he shot his arrows among the people, but upon  the tenth day Achilles called them in assembly- moved thereto by Juno,  who saw the Achaeans in their death-throes and had compassion upon them.  Then, when they were got together, he rose and spoke among  them.  
"Son of Atreus," said he, "I deem that we should now turn roving  home if we would escape destruction, for we are being cut down by war and  pestilence at once. Let us ask some priest or prophet, or some reader of  dreams (for dreams, too, are of Jove) who can tell us why Phoebus Apollo  is so angry, and say whether it is for some vow that we have broken, or  hecatomb that we have not offered, and whether he will accept the savour  of lambs and goats without blemish, so as to take away the plague from  us."  
With these words he sat down, and Calchas son of Thestor, wisest  of augurs, who knew things past present and to come, rose to speak. He  it was who had guided the Achaeans with their fleet to Ilius, through the  prophesyings with which Phoebus Apollo had inspired him. With all sincerity  and goodwill he addressed them thus:-  
"Achilles, loved of heaven, you bid me tell you about the anger  of King Apollo, I will therefore do so; but consider first and swear that  you will stand by me heartily in word and deed, for I know that I shall  offend one who rules the Argives with might, to whom all the Achaeans are  in subjection. A plain man cannot stand against the anger of a king, who  if he swallow his displeasure now, will yet nurse revenge till he has wreaked  it. Consider, therefore, whether or no you will protect  me."  
And Achilles answered, "Fear not, but speak as it is borne in upon  you from heaven, for by Apollo, Calchas, to whom you pray, and whose oracles  you reveal to us, not a Danaan at our ships shall lay his hand upon you,  while I yet live to look upon the face of the earth- no, not though you  name Agamemnon himself, who is by far the foremost of the  Achaeans."  
Thereon the seer spoke boldly. "The god," he said, "is angry neither  about vow nor hecatomb, but for his priest's sake, whom Agamemnon has dishonoured,  in that he would not free his daughter nor take a ransom for her; therefore  has he sent these evils upon us, and will yet send others. He will not  deliver the Danaans from this pestilence till Agamemnon has restored the  girl without fee or ransom to her father, and has sent a holy hecatomb  to Chryse. Thus we may perhaps appease him."  
With these words he sat down, and Agamemnon rose in anger. His  heart was black with rage, and his eyes flashed fire as he scowled on Calchas  and said, "Seer of evil, you never yet prophesied smooth things concerning  me, but have ever loved to foretell that which was evil. You have brought  me neither comfort nor performance; and now you come seeing among Danaans,  and saying that Apollo has plagued us because I would not take a ransom  for this girl, the daughter of Chryses. I have set my heart on keeping  her in my own house, for I love her better even than my own wife Clytemnestra,  whose peer she is alike in form and feature, in understanding and accomplishments.  Still I will give her up if I must, for I would have the people live, not  die; but you must find me a prize instead, or I alone among the Argives  shall be without one. This is not well; for you behold, all of you, that  my prize is to go elsewhither."  
And Achilles answered, "Most noble son of Atreus, covetous beyond  all mankind, how shall the Achaeans find you another prize? We have no  common store from which to take one. Those we took from the cities have  been awarded; we cannot disallow the awards that have been made already.  Give this girl, therefore, to the god, and if ever Jove grants us to sack  the city of Troy we will requite you three and fourfold."  
Then Agamemnon said, "Achilles, valiant though you be, you shall  not thus outwit me. You shall not overreach and you shall not persuade  me. Are you to keep your own prize, while I sit tamely under my loss and  give up the girl at your bidding? Let the Achaeans find me a prize in fair  exchange to my liking, or I will come and take your own, or that of Ajax  or of Ulysses; and he to whomsoever I may come shall rue my coming. But  of this we will take thought hereafter; for the present, let us draw a  ship into the sea, and find a crew for her expressly; let us put a hecatomb  on board, and let us send Chryseis also; further, let some chief man among  us be in command, either Ajax, or Idomeneus, or yourself, son of Peleus,  mighty warrior that you are, that we may offer sacrifice and appease the  the anger of the god."  
Achilles scowled at him and answered, "You are steeped in insolence  and lust of gain. With what heart can any of the Achaeans do your bidding,  either on foray or in open fighting? I came not warring here for any ill  the Trojans had done me. I have no quarrel with them. They have not raided  my cattle nor my horses, nor cut down my harvests on the rich plains of  Phthia; for between me and them there is a great space, both mountain and  sounding sea. We have followed you, Sir Insolence! for your pleasure, not  ours- to gain satisfaction from the Trojans for your shameless self and  for Menelaus. You forget this, and threaten to rob me of the prize for  which I have toiled, and which the sons of the Achaeans have given me.  Never when the Achaeans sack any rich city of the Trojans do I receive  so good a prize as you do, though it is my hands that do the better part  of the fighting. When the sharing comes, your share is far the largest,  and I, forsooth, must go back to my ships, take what I can get and be thankful,  when my labour of fighting is done. Now, therefore, I shall go back to  Phthia; it will be much better for me to return home with my ships, for  I will not stay here dishonoured to gather gold and substance for  you."  
And Agamemnon answered, "Fly if you will, I shall make you no prayers  to stay you. I have others here who will do me honour, and above all Jove,  the lord of counsel. There is no king here so hateful to me as you are,  for you are ever quarrelsome and ill affected. What though you be brave?  Was it not heaven that made you so? Go home, then, with your ships and  comrades to lord it over the Myrmidons. I care neither for you nor for  your anger; and thus will I do: since Phoebus Apollo is taking Chryseis  from me, I shall send her with my ship and my followers, but I shall come  to your tent and take your own prize Briseis, that you may learn how much  stronger I am than you are, and that another may fear to set himself up  as equal or comparable with me."  
The son of Peleus was furious, and his heart within his shaggy  breast was divided whether to draw his sword, push the others aside, and  kill the son of Atreus, or to restrain himself and check his anger. While  he was thus in two minds, and was drawing his mighty sword from its scabbard,  Minerva came down from heaven (for Juno had sent her in the love she bore  to them both), and seized the son of Peleus by his yellow hair, visible  to him alone, for of the others no man could see her. Achilles turned in  amaze, and by the fire that flashed from her eyes at once knew that she  was Minerva. "Why are you here," said he, "daughter of aegis-bearing Jove?  To see the pride of Agamemnon, son of Atreus? Let me tell you- and it shall  surely be- he shall pay for this insolence with his  life."  
And Minerva said, "I come from heaven, if you will hear me, to  bid you stay your anger. Juno has sent me, who cares for both of you alike.  Cease, then, this brawling, and do not draw your sword; rail at him if  you will, and your railing will not be vain, for I tell you- and it shall  surely be- that you shall hereafter receive gifts three times as splendid  by reason of this present insult. Hold, therefore, and  obey."  
"Goddess," answered Achilles, "however angry a man may be, he must  do as you two command him. This will be best, for the gods ever hear the  prayers of him who has obeyed them."  
He stayed his hand on the silver hilt of his sword, and thrust  it back into the scabbard as Minerva bade him. Then she went back to Olympus  among the other gods, and to the house of aegis-bearing  Jove.  
But the son of Peleus again began railing at the son of Atreus,  for he was still in a rage. "Wine-bibber," he cried, "with the face of  a dog and the heart of a hind, you never dare to go out with the host in  fight, nor yet with our chosen men in ambuscade. You shun this as you do  death itself. You had rather go round and rob his prizes from any man who  contradicts you. You devour your people, for you are king over a feeble  folk; otherwise, son of Atreus, henceforward you would insult no man. Therefore  I say, and swear it with a great oath- nay, by this my sceptre which shalt  sprout neither leaf nor shoot, nor bud anew from the day on which it left  its parent stem upon the mountains- for the axe stripped it of leaf and  bark, and now the sons of the Achaeans bear it as judges and guardians  of the decrees of heaven- so surely and solemnly do I swear that hereafter  they shall look fondly for Achilles and shall not find him. In the day  of your distress, when your men fall dying by the murderous hand of Hector,  you shall not know how to help them, and shall rend your heart with rage  for the hour when you offered insult to the bravest of the  Achaeans."  
With this the son of Peleus dashed his gold-bestudded sceptre on  the ground and took his seat, while the son of Atreus was beginning fiercely  from his place upon the other side. Then uprose smooth-tongued Nestor,  the facile speaker of the Pylians, and the words fell from his lips sweeter  than honey. Two generations of men born and bred in Pylos had passed away  under his rule, and he was now reigning over the third. With all sincerity  and goodwill, therefore, he addressed them thus:-  
"Of a truth," he said, "a great sorrow has befallen the Achaean  land. Surely Priam with his sons would rejoice, and the Trojans be glad  at heart if they could hear this quarrel between you two, who are so excellent  in fight and counsel. I am older than either of you; therefore be guided  by me. Moreover I have been the familiar friend of men even greater than  you are, and they did not disregard my counsels. Never again can I behold  such men as Pirithous and Dryas shepherd of his people, or as Caeneus,  Exadius, godlike Polyphemus, and Theseus son of Aegeus, peer of the immortals.  These were the mightiest men ever born upon this earth: mightiest were  they, and when they fought the fiercest tribes of mountain savages they  utterly overthrew them. I came from distant Pylos, and went about among  them, for they would have me come, and I fought as it was in me to do.  Not a man now living could withstand them, but they heard my words, and  were persuaded by them. So be it also with yourselves, for this is the  more excellent way. Therefore, Agamemnon, though you be strong, take not  this girl away, for the sons of the Achaeans have already given her to  Achilles; and you, Achilles, strive not further with the king, for no man  who by the grace of Jove wields a sceptre has like honour with Agamemnon.  You are strong, and have a goddess for your mother; but Agamemnon is stronger  than you, for he has more people under him. Son of Atreus, check your anger,  I implore you; end this quarrel with Achilles, who in the day of battle  is a tower of strength to the Achaeans."  
And Agamemnon answered, "Sir, all that you have said is true, but  this fellow must needs become our lord and master: he must be lord of all,  king of all, and captain of all, and this shall hardly be. Granted that  the gods have made him a great warrior, have they also given him the right  to speak with railing?"  
Achilles interrupted him. "I should be a mean coward," he cried,  "were I to give in to you in all things. Order other people about, not  me, for I shall obey no longer. Furthermore I say- and lay my saying to  your heart- I shall fight neither you nor any man about this girl, for  those that take were those also that gave. But of all else that is at my  ship you shall carry away nothing by force. Try, that others may see; if  you do, my spear shall be reddened with your blood."  
When they had quarrelled thus angrily, they rose, and broke up  the assembly at the ships of the Achaeans. The son of Peleus went back  to his tents and ships with the son of Menoetius and his company, while  Agamemnon drew a vessel into the water and chose a crew of twenty oarsmen.  He escorted Chryseis on board and sent moreover a hecatomb for the god.  And Ulysses went as captain.  
These, then, went on board and sailed their ways over the sea.  But the son of Atreus bade the people purify themselves; so they purified  themselves and cast their filth into the sea. Then they offered hecatombs  of bulls and goats without blemish on the sea-shore, and the smoke with  the savour of their sacrifice rose curling up towards  heaven.  
Thus did they busy themselves throughout the host. But Agamemnon  did not forget the threat that he had made Achilles, and called his trusty  messengers and squires Talthybius and Eurybates. "Go," said he, "to the  tent of Achilles, son of Peleus; take Briseis by the hand and bring her  hither; if he will not give her I shall come with others and take her-  which will press him harder."  
He charged them straightly further and dismissed them, whereon  they went their way sorrowfully by the seaside, till they came to the tents  and ships of the Myrmidons. They found Achilles sitting by his tent and  his ships, and ill-pleased he was when he beheld them. They stood fearfully  and reverently before him, and never a word did they speak, but he knew  them and said, "Welcome, heralds, messengers of gods and men; draw near;  my quarrel is not with you but with Agamemnon who has sent you for the  girl Briseis. Therefore, Patroclus, bring her and give her to them, but  let them be witnesses by the blessed gods, by mortal men, and by the fierceness  of Agamemnon's anger, that if ever again there be need of me to save the  people from ruin, they shall seek and they shall not find. Agamemnon is  mad with rage and knows not how to look before and after that the Achaeans  may fight by their ships in safety."  
Patroclus did as his dear comrade had bidden him. He brought Briseis  from the tent and gave her over to the heralds, who took her with them  to the ships of the Achaeans- and the woman was loth to go. Then Achilles  went all alone by the side of the hoar sea, weeping and looking out upon  the boundless waste of waters. He raised his hands in prayer to his immortal  mother, "Mother," he cried, "you bore me doomed to live but for a little  season; surely Jove, who thunders from Olympus, might have made that little  glorious. It is not so. Agamemnon, son of Atreus, has done me dishonour,  and has robbed me of my prize by force."  
As he spoke he wept aloud, and his mother heard him where she was  sitting in the depths of the sea hard by the old man her father. Forthwith  she rose as it were a grey mist out of the waves, sat down before him as  he stood weeping, caressed him with her hand, and said, "My son, why are  you weeping? What is it that grieves you? Keep it not from me, but tell  me, that we may know it together."  
Achilles drew a deep sigh and said, "You know it; why tell you  what you know well already? We went to Thebe the strong city of Eetion,  sacked it, and brought hither the spoil. The sons of the Achaeans shared  it duly among themselves, and chose lovely Chryseis as the meed of Agamemnon;  but Chryses, priest of Apollo, came to the ships of the Achaeans to free  his daughter, and brought with him a great ransom: moreover he bore in  his hand the sceptre of Apollo, wreathed with a suppliant's wreath, and  he besought the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus who were  their chiefs.  
"On this the rest of the Achaeans with one voice were for respecting  the priest and taking the ransom that he offered; but not so Agamemnon,  who spoke fiercely to him and sent him roughly away. So he went back in  anger, and Apollo, who loved him dearly, heard his prayer. Then the god  sent a deadly dart upon the Argives, and the people died thick on one another,  for the arrows went everywhither among the wide host of the Achaeans. At  last a seer in the fulness of his knowledge declared to us the oracles  of Apollo, and I was myself first to say that we should appease him. Whereon  the son of Atreus rose in anger, and threatened that which he has since  done. The Achaeans are now taking the girl in a ship to Chryse, and sending  gifts of sacrifice to the god; but the heralds have just taken from my  tent the daughter of Briseus, whom the Achaeans had awarded to  myself.  
"Help your brave son, therefore, if you are able. Go to Olympus,  and if you have ever done him service in word or deed, implore the aid  of Jove. Ofttimes in my father's house have I heard you glory in that you  alone of the immortals saved the son of Saturn from ruin, when the others,  with Juno, Neptune, and Pallas Minerva would have put him in bonds. It  was you, goddess, who delivered him by calling to Olympus the hundred-handed  monster whom gods call Briareus, but men Aegaeon, for he is stronger even  than his father; when therefore he took his seat all-glorious beside the  son of Saturn, the other gods were afraid, and did not bind him. Go, then,  to him, remind him of all this, clasp his knees, and bid him give succour  to the Trojans. Let the Achaeans be hemmed in at the sterns of their ships,  and perish on the sea-shore, that they may reap what joy they may of their  king, and that Agamemnon may rue his blindness in offering insult to the  foremost of the Achaeans."  
Thetis wept and answered, "My son, woe is me that I should have  borne or suckled you. Would indeed that you had lived your span free from  all sorrow at your ships, for it is all too brief; alas, that you should  be at once short of life and long of sorrow above your peers: woe, therefore,  was the hour in which I bore you; nevertheless I will go to the snowy heights  of Olympus, and tell this tale to Jove, if he will hear our prayer: meanwhile  stay where you are with your ships, nurse your anger against the Achaeans,  and hold aloof from fight. For Jove went yesterday to Oceanus, to a feast  among the Ethiopians, and the other gods went with him. He will return  to Olympus twelve days hence; I will then go to his mansion paved with  bronze and will beseech him; nor do I doubt that I shall be able to persuade  him."  
On this she left him, still furious at the loss of her that had  been taken from him. Meanwhile Ulysses reached Chryse with the hecatomb.  When they had come inside the harbour they furled the sails and laid them  in the ship's hold; they slackened the forestays, lowered the mast into  its place, and rowed the ship to the place where they would have her lie;  there they cast out their mooring-stones and made fast the hawsers. They  then got out upon the sea-shore and landed the hecatomb for Apollo; Chryseis  also left the ship, and Ulysses led her to the altar to deliver her into  the hands of her father. "Chryses," said he, "King Agamemnon has sent me  to bring you back your child, and to offer sacrifice to Apollo on behalf  of the Danaans, that we may propitiate the god, who has now brought sorrow  upon the Argives."  
So saying he gave the girl over to her father, who received her  gladly, and they ranged the holy hecatomb all orderly round the altar of  the god. They washed their hands and took up the barley-meal to sprinkle  over the victims, while Chryses lifted up his hands and prayed aloud on  their behalf. "Hear me," he cried, "O god of the silver bow, that protectest  Chryse and holy Cilla, and rulest Tenedos with thy might. Even as thou  didst hear me aforetime when I prayed, and didst press hardly upon the  Achaeans, so hear me yet again, and stay this fearful pestilence from the  Danaans."  
Thus did he pray, and Apollo heard his prayer. When they had done  praying and sprinkling the barley-meal, they drew back the heads of the  victims and killed and flayed them. They cut out the thigh-bones, wrapped  them round in two layers of fat, set some pieces of raw meat on the top  of them, and then Chryses laid them on the wood fire and poured wine over  them, while the young men stood near him with five-pronged spits in their  hands. When the thigh-bones were burned and they had tasted the inward  meats, they cut the rest up small, put the pieces upon the spits, roasted  them till they were done, and drew them off: then, when they had finished  their work and the feast was ready, they ate it, and every man had his  full share, so that all were satisfied. As soon as they had had enough  to eat and drink, pages filled the mixing-bowl with wine and water and  handed it round, after giving every man his drink-offering.  
Thus all day long the young men worshipped the god with song, hymning  him and chaunting the joyous paean, and the god took pleasure in their  voices; but when the sun went down, and it came on dark, they laid themselves  down to sleep by the stern cables of the ship, and when the child of morning,  rosy-fingered Dawn, appeared they again set sail for the host of the Achaeans.  Apollo sent them a fair wind, so they raised their mast and hoisted their  white sails aloft. As the sail bellied with the wind the ship flew through  the deep blue water, and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward.  When they reached the wide-stretching host of the Achaeans, they drew the  vessel ashore, high and dry upon the sands, set her strong props beneath  her, and went their ways to their own tents and ships.  
But Achilles abode at his ships and nursed his anger. He went not  to the honourable assembly, and sallied not forth to fight, but gnawed  at his own heart, pining for battle and the war-cry.  
Now after twelve days the immortal gods came back in a body to  Olympus, and Jove led the way. Thetis was not unmindful of the charge her  son had laid upon her, so she rose from under the sea and went through  great heaven with early morning to Olympus, where she found the mighty  son of Saturn sitting all alone upon its topmost ridges. She sat herself  down before him, and with her left hand seized his knees, while with her  right she caught him under the chin, and besought him,  saying-  
"Father Jove, if I ever did you service in word or deed among the  immortals, hear my prayer, and do honour to my son, whose life is to be  cut short so early. King Agamemnon has dishonoured him by taking his prize  and keeping her. Honour him then yourself, Olympian lord of counsel, and  grant victory to the Trojans, till the Achaeans give my son his due and  load him with riches in requital."  
Jove sat for a while silent, and without a word, but Thetis still  kept firm hold of his knees, and besought him a second time. "Incline your  head," said she, "and promise me surely, or else deny me- for you have  nothing to fear- that I may learn how greatly you disdain  me."  
At this Jove was much troubled and answered, "I shall have trouble  if you set me quarrelling with Juno, for she will provoke me with her taunting  speeches; even now she is always railing at me before the other gods and  accusing me of giving aid to the Trojans. Go back now, lest she should  find out. I will consider the matter, and will bring it about as wish.  See, I incline my head that you believe me. This is the most solemn that  I can give to any god. I never recall my word, or deceive, or fail to do  what I say, when I have nodded my head."  
As he spoke the son of Saturn bowed his dark brows, and the ambrosial  locks swayed on his immortal head, till vast Olympus  reeled.  
When the pair had thus laid their plans, they parted- Jove to his  house, while the goddess quitted the splendour of Olympus, and plunged  into the depths of the sea. The gods rose from their seats, before the  coming of their sire. Not one of them dared to remain sitting, but all  stood up as he came among them. There, then, he took his seat. But Juno,  when she saw him, knew that he and the old merman's daughter, silver-footed  Thetis, had been hatching mischief, so she at once began to upbraid him.  "Trickster," she cried, "which of the gods have you been taking into your  counsels now? You are always settling matters in secret behind my back,  and have never yet told me, if you could help it, one word of your  intentions."  
"Juno," replied the sire of gods and men, "you must not expect  to be informed of all my counsels. You are my wife, but you would find  it hard to understand them. When it is proper for you to hear, there is  no one, god or man, who will be told sooner, but when I mean to keep a  matter to myself, you must not pry nor ask questions."  
"Dread son of Saturn," answered Juno, "what are you talking about?  I? Pry and ask questions? Never. I let you have your own way in everything.  Still, I have a strong misgiving that the old merman's daughter Thetis  has been talking you over, for she was with you and had hold of your knees  this self-same morning. I believe, therefore, that you have been promising  her to give glory to Achilles, and to kill much people at the ships of  the Achaeans."  
"Wife," said Jove, "I can do nothing but you suspect me and find  it out. You will take nothing by it, for I shall only dislike you the more,  and it will go harder with you. Granted that it is as you say; I mean to  have it so; sit down and hold your tongue as I bid you for if I once begin  to lay my hands about you, though all heaven were on your side it would  profit you nothing."  
On this Juno was frightened, so she curbed her stubborn will and  sat down in silence. But the heavenly beings were disquieted throughout  the house of Jove, till the cunning workman Vulcan began to try and pacify  his mother Juno. "It will be intolerable," said he, "if you two fall to  wrangling and setting heaven in an uproar about a pack of mortals. If such  ill counsels are to prevail, we shall have no pleasure at our banquet.  Let me then advise my mother- and she must herself know that it will be  better- to make friends with my dear father Jove, lest he again scold her  and disturb our feast. If the Olympian Thunderer wants to hurl us all from  our seats, he can do so, for he is far the strongest, so give him fair  words, and he will then soon be in a good humour with  us."  
As he spoke, he took a double cup of nectar, and placed it in his  mother's hand. "Cheer up, my dear mother," said he, "and make the best  of it. I love you dearly, and should be very sorry to see you get a thrashing;  however grieved I might be, I could not help for there is no standing against  Jove. Once before when I was trying to help you, he caught me by the foot  and flung me from the heavenly threshold. All day long from morn till eve,  was I falling, till at sunset I came to ground in the island of Lemnos,  and there I lay, with very little life left in me, till the Sintians came  and tended me."  
Juno smiled at this, and as she smiled she took the cup from her  son's hands. Then Vulcan drew sweet nectar from the mixing-bowl, and served  it round among the gods, going from left to right; and the blessed gods  laughed out a loud applause as they saw him ing bustling about the heavenly  mansion.  
Thus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun they  feasted, and every one had his full share, so that all were satisfied.  Apollo struck his lyre, and the Muses lifted up their sweet voices, calling  and answering one another. But when the sun's glorious light had faded,  they went home to bed, each in his own abode, which lame Vulcan with his  consummate skill had fashioned for them. So Jove, the Olympian Lord of  Thunder, hied him to the bed in which he always slept; and when he had  got on to it he went to sleep, with Juno of the golden throne by his  side.

-=-=-TITLE:  The <b>Iliad</b>
-=-=-SNIPPET:  s The Iliad? Check out our thorough summary and nanalysis of this literary masterpiece., u
-=-=-TEXT: First making its appearance in scroll-format around the 8th century B.C., the Iliad is the earliest known work of European literature. From this perspective, you could say that European literature peaked pretty early; since then, you'd be hard-pressed to find a work that comes close to the Iliad for depth of insight into human life, as well as sheer beauty. (OK, a strong contender would be Homer's Odyssey, though it might be better to think of these two works as complementing, rather than competing with, each other.) How did this happen? The fact is that, even though the Iliad stands at the beginning of one tradition – the written tradition – it also comes at the end of an entirely different tradition. One way of thinking about the Iliad is as a survivor of a form of purely oral poetry passed down from generation to generation without ever being written down.
We say "one way" because, as with any topic where nobody has any firm proof, the so-called "Homeric Question" has spun out more theories and disagreements than the local coffee shop on a weekday afternoon. Let's begin with some cold hard facts. For starters, most of the Ancient Greek authors we read today (that is, guys writing at least 100 years after the Iliad first came out on papyrus), thought that both the Iliad and the Odyssey were written by a single poet named Homer. That's right, written. Nobody knew anything about who Homer was – though, of course, there were plenty of theories. Now flash forward to the late eighteenth century, when people started thinking that Homer was an illiterate composer of songs that eventually got stitched into the epics as we know them. This kicked off another furious round of arguments – about what the original "parts" of the Iliad were, and how they fit together. The fact that the poem is remarkably tight in the way it hangs together didn't seem to bother anybody.
The next major shift came in the early twentieth century. That's when the young American scholar Milman Parry noticed that the way the Iliad tended to repeat certain phrases reminded him of the oral poetry coming out of what was then called Yugoslavia. Like most poetry, the Homeric poems follow a fixed rhythm – something called "dactylic hexameter." (You can read about it here.) Parry found that some of these repeated phrases – things like "brilliant Achilleus" or "dawn with her rosy fingers" – always turned up in the same position in the hexameter line. Based on this, Parry thought that the poet must have used these phrases as building blocks that could be recombined on the spot – just like jazz improvisation or freestyling in rap.
Fair enough. The only problem is, even if the Iliad was composed completely orally, nobody knows how that oral poem then ended up being written down. On the other hand, if the poem was originally written down, wouldn't it make sense for a poet growing up in an oral culture to follow the style he (or she) was used to? At the end of the day, though, the great thing about the "Homeric Question" is that it doesn't matter. No matter what your theory about the author, one fact that everyone agrees on is the true genius and artistry of the Homeric poems. These are what keep readers of every stripe coming back to them again and again.
Why should you care? Oh, you mean, besides because the Iliad is pretty much the most famous work of fiction ever written? And besides because it is one of the two or three foundational texts for all of western culture (right up there with the Bible and, um… yeah, let’s go with one of the two foundational texts)?
If that doesn't satisfy you, Shmoopers, maybe this will" The Iliad is the basis of and the model for every kind of war narrative, action movie, superhero comic, and adventure saga that has come after it. That’s right, people, we’re looking at the zero point right here. 
You want large scale clashing armies? You’ve come to the right place. Even matched duels or obviously unmatched duels? Check out the long one-on-one combat descriptions, or that crazy nonsense between Paris and Menelaus. Spy thriller? Odysseus’s nighttime raid totally fits the bill. Nail-biting special ops missions? The Trojan Horse ruse has your name written all over it. Swords-and-sorcerers magic adventure? Try anything with the gods busting in on the action, like, say, that whole Laocoon fiasco. Snakes—yikes. In short, anything exciting you’ve ever seen or heard or read started right here.
But that’s not all. Not only does the Iliad put the act into action, but it puts the philosophy in there, too. This isn’t just a reductive Good Guys versus Bad Guys bit of disposable nothing. Instead, what’s behind all that fighting is a whole lot of thinking about what the fighting means. 
For instance, why fight at all? Why not just sit around and wait for the war to end or for death or whatever else is coming down the pike? Or for another example, just how much is one man’s honor worth? Worth upsetting a king’s plans? Yeah, probably. Leading to the deaths of a lot of others? Um… maybe not. See what we mean? 
Through question after question, through fight after fight, the Iliad is slowly working out the ethics of war, the morals of individuals, and how our individual humanity fits into the greater social fabric. But, you know, with a lot of awesome gore and people totally getting stabbed through the eyeballs and stuff.

For starters, most of the Ancient Greek authors we read today (that is, guys writing at least 100 years after the Iliad first came out on papyrus), thought that both the Iliad and the Odyssey were written by a single poet named Homer. That's right, written. Nobody knew anything about who Homer was – though, of course, there were plenty of theories. Now flash forward to the late eighteenth century, when people started thinking that Homer was an illiterate composer of songs that eventually got stitched into the epics as we know them. This kicked off another furious round of arguments – about what the original "parts" of the Iliad were, and how they fit together. The fact that the poem is remarkably tight in the way it hangs together didn't seem to bother anybody.
The next major shift came in the early twentieth century. That's when the young American scholar Milman Parry noticed that the way the Iliad tended to repeat certain phrases reminded him of the oral poetry coming out of what was then called Yugoslavia. Like most poetry, the Homeric poems follow a fixed rhythm – something called "dactylic hexameter." (You can read about it here.) Parry found that some of these repeated phrases – things like "brilliant Achilleus" or "dawn with her rosy fingers" – always turned up in the same position in the hexameter line. Based on this, Parry thought that the poet must have used these phrases as building blocks that could be recombined on the spot – just like jazz improvisation or freestyling in rap.
Fair enough. The only problem is, even if the Iliad was composed completely orally, nobody knows how that oral poem then ended up being written down. On the other hand, if the poem was originally written down, wouldn't it make sense for a poet growing up in an oral culture to follow the style he (or she) was used to? At the end of the day, though, the great thing about the "Homeric Question" is that it doesn't matter. No matter what your theory about the author, one fact that everyone agrees on is the true genius and artistry of the Homeric poems. These are what keep readers of every stripe coming back to them again and again.
Why should you care? Oh, you mean, besides because the Iliad is pretty much the most famous work of fiction ever written? And besides because it is one of the two or three foundational texts for all of western culture (right up there with the Bible and, um… yeah, let’s go with one of the two foundational texts)?
If that doesn't satisfy you, Shmoopers, maybe this will" The Iliad is the basis of and the model for every kind of war narrative, action movie, superhero comic, and adventure saga that has come after it. That’s right, people, we’re looking at the zero point right here. 
You want large scale clashing armies? You’ve come to the right place. Even matched duels or obviously unmatched duels? Check out the long one-on-one combat descriptions, or that crazy nonsense between Paris and Menelaus. Spy thriller? Odysseus’s nighttime raid totally fits the bill. Nail-biting special ops missions? The Trojan Horse ruse has your name written all over it. Swords-and-sorcerers magic adventure? Try anything with the gods busting in on the action, like, say, that whole Laocoon fiasco. Snakes—yikes. In short, anything exciting you’ve ever seen or heard or read started right here.
But that’s not all. Not only does the Iliad put the act into action, but it puts the philosophy in there, too. This isn’t just a reductive Good Guys versus Bad Guys bit of disposable nothing. Instead, what’s behind all that fighting is a whole lot of thinking about what the fighting means. 
For instance, why fight at all? Why not just sit around and wait for the war to end or for death or whatever else is coming down the pike? Or for another example, just how much is one man’s honor worth? Worth upsetting a king’s plans? Yeah, probably. Leading to the deaths of a lot of others? Um… maybe not. See what we mean? 
Through question after question, through fight after fight, the Iliad is slowly working out the ethics of war, the morals of individuals, and how our individual humanity fits into the greater social fabric. But, you know, with a lot of awesome gore and people totally getting stabbed through the eyeballs and stuff.

                          By          Esquire     on June 23, 2002  
Format: Paperback         I won't try to give yet another summary of the Iliad's plot nor give my insignificant opinion on the importance of Homer to Western Culture. More important is to discuss this translation and the translation of Homer in general.
When it comes to classic works of poetry in translation, such as those of Homer, Vergil, Dante and others, the translation makes all the difference. The type of translation, whether in rhyming verse, blank verse, prose etc., whether it is a strict line by line or more liberal translation, whether the wording and idioms are old fashioned or modern, can play such a great role that one translation may be completely different than another. This fact is probably often overlooked and attributes to the neglect of these classics, since a bad or difficult translation makes the poem seem tedious or dull.
Since Chapman's first translation of Homer into English in 1611 there have been dozens of others. Chapman's translation remains a classic, though its heavy and elaborate rhyming Elizabethan style and old wording make it quite laborious to read today. The next great translation was that of the renowned Enlightenment poet Alexander Pope; his Iliad was published progressively between 1715 and 1720. Pope's translation is in rhyming verse with his heroic couplet and is eminently poetic. It is considered the greatest translation of Homer into English (Dr. Johnson called it "the noblest version of poetry which the world has ever seen") but it is not as plain and straightforward as Homer apparently is in the original. It is mostly for this reason that Pope's translation has been critized as being more the work of the poet Pope than the poet Homer.
Of the more recent verse translations a few are worth recommendation. Read more ›

            75 of 79 people found the following review helpful  The best Iliad for the general reader  
                     By          Scott Chamberlain    VINE VOICE     on September 2, 2005  
Format: Paperback         The Iliad is one of the greatest treasures of Western Civilization-and not just because a teacher told you it was.  On the surface, it offers raw emotions, visceral action sequences and colorful characters you admire and hate, often at the same time.  But it is much, much deeper than that.  The scene where Hector bids his young wife good-bye and holds up his infant son to the gods, praying that the boy will one day be a better man than ever he himself was, has never been equaled as a statement of what it means to be a man, husband or father.  The debates about honor and duty are still the same we face every day.  The humanity, insight and profound philosophy are remarkable-especially for a work now 3,000 years old.

The problem?  How do you convey all that power?  How do you do so in a way that captures the feel of original?

Iliad translations have started to come fast and furious, as every ten years or so someone tries to tackle the monumental task of bringing the poem to modern readers.  The process isn't helped by the fact that the text was already 300 years old to the classical Greeks like Aristotle, Sophocles and Euripides-making it as vaguely old-fashioned as Shakespeare is to us.  Should it sound antiquated to us, too?  If you really want a line by line translation, one that has some kind of meter that approaches the Greek original, the obvious choice is Lattimore's classic translation.  It has the side benefit now of being somewhat dated in its English usage too.  That said, for just a good ol' read of the Iliad, Lattimore isn't even my third choice.  For all its accuracy, I've always felt I was reading a textbook, written by a classics scholar rather than an honest-to-goodness writer. Read more ›

            164 of 179 people found the following review helpful  A readable Iliad in modern idiom  
                     By          Michael Wells Glueck     on June 29, 2002  
Format: Paperback         Robert Fagles's translation of Homer's Iliad is spiritually if not literally true to the original. Both versions repeat set speeches and descriptions in precisely the same words, and the translation exhibits a fairly regular rhythmic beat. But Homer's Greek was chanted, and the set passages were like refrains in which listeners could, if they chose, join in as a chorus. In English, the repetitions sometimes become tedious, especially when the same speech is given three times in two pages, as in the relay of Zeus's orders in Book II. Especially noteworthy is Bernard Knox's long and fascinating Introduction, a masterpiece of literary criticism and scholarship which conveys Homer's grim attitude toward war, the interplay of divine and human will, and the ancient concepts of honor, courage, and virility in the face of the stark finality of death. Knox also includes a succinct explanation of the quantitative, rather than accentual, basis of Greek (and Latin) verse. For easy readability, Fagles's translation is without rival. For elegance and poetry, however, I recommend Richmond Lattimore's older but still gripping and fluent translation.

            97 of 104 people found the following review helpful  Narration before Translation  
                     By          Todd F.     on December 15, 2006  
Format: Audio CD         Upon reading reviews of various audiobooks, I find that most reviewers comment too much upon the translation and too little upon the narration. Translation choice is certainly important but I think you have to find a narrator who makes the story exciting. After having listened to both the narration by George Guidall of the Fitzgerald translation and Derek Jacobi's narration of Robert Fagles' translation, I would say I prefer the Jacobi recording.  Although both men give good performances, I think that Derek Jacobi's reading is the better of the two because his tempo and inflection more closely mirror the pitch and pause of the narrative drama. Regardless of which translator you prefer, the narration should take precedence over the choice of translation. I actually prefer Fitzgerald to Fagles as a translator and I'm not crazy about an abridged version of The Iliad in the Derek Jacobi (Fagles) audiobook. But if you're going to listen to a few hours of Homer, you'd better like the voice in the ether. I don't think you could go wrong with either of these two narrations but I would advise you to find some audio samples to compare performances before you make your purchase.

-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: I don't drink or smoke, so when I want to wind down after a long day, feel-good films are my vice: Lifetime movies, anything by Tyler Perry and anything with J Lo. Naturally, when I found out that she was co-producing and starring in a new flick, I looked forward to it. Lopez's roles are usually light-hearted and fun if not taken too seriously, and since the screenplay was written by a woman, and Lopez is unafraid to publicly identify as a feminist, I was interested in seeing what she would produce. But rather than feeling relaxed, or even just grateful that my life is monumentally easier than the protagonist's -- the way I usually feel after watching similar movies -- I was left feeling disturbed, uncomfortable and frankly, a little irritated.
I'd like to start off by stressing that I'm not delusional; as an enjoyer of light, fluffy plot lines, nonsensical rom-coms, hilarious horror and dramatically over-the-top Lifetime flicks, I was ready to overlook a lot because I knew what I was signing up for. Our anti-hero has a painfully obvious Oedipus complex? Love it. The main character's a "classics" teacher who's newest yet oldest student just gave her a "first edition" of The Iliad ? LOL. She teaches juniors, yet the new kid is pushing 20 (and looks more like 30)? No problem. She never bothers to alert the police even though she's "not scared" because "who are they going to believe?" Weird, but OK!
What I couldn't reconcile was the film's depiction of Kristin Chenoweth's character, who plays Lopez's confidante, BFF and superior. Throughout, the audience is sent clear signals about the vast differences between Vicky (played by Kristin) and Claire (J Lo). Vicky is a "bad girl" -- she's authoritative, she doesn't take shit,and she makes the inexcusable mistake of "trying" to be sexy. In fact, she shamelessly asserts her sexuality. She's a femme fatale, and she must be severely punished for her transgressions. By contrast, Claire is "good": she dresses modestly, she wears spectacles and reads "classics," she wants to forgive her philandering husband and she initially tries to resist the forceful come-ons of the man/boy she's branded as some sort of buff Byronic hero. "Nice" or "good girls," with their sexually submissive attitudes and eternal fountain of forgiveness for their male counterparts (who can't be held responsible for their lusty desires, after all) can in turn, be absolved for their sins. "Bad girls," on the other hand, must pay.
Claire is presented to the audience as more desirable than Vicky. When the Homer-quoting Heathcliff wannabe named Noah comments on Claire's shoes, she confesses that they're actually Vicky's. He announces his approval. The shoes are for women who trying to be sexy (how awful!), and Claire doesn't need to try. Because her marriage is on the rocks, Claire is more flattered than put off by this chauvinistic remark.
Then, when Claire comes over a few days later, he practically forces himself on her, as she says "no" what seems like hundreds of times. But she gives in; after all, how could she resist his manly charms? Although the sex looks more stilted than steamy, apparently Noah was satisfied because the next morning, he acts creepily delusional. The whole scene was confusing to me because I wasn't sure who would be turned on by watching it. As a woman, I felt uneasy with how Noah refused to take "no" for an answer and again brushed off Claire's misgivings in the morning. If I was male, I'd be rolling my eyes at all the close-ups on our hunky Heathcliff's torso, while Lopez coyly used her blanket to avoid full-frontal. So far, the movie has sent a pretty clear message to viewers that men are by nature sexual and aggressive, and women should relent, know their place and not "try too hard."
But no, the movie isn't done beating its point into the ground, literally. Due to his inability to comprehend rejection, Noah's behaviour becomes increasingly troubling. He tampers with the brakes in Claire's husband's car. He almost kills a skater boy for taunting Claire's son (although he doesn't appear to particularly care for her son -- sleeping with his hardware-store hottie love interest, trying to off his father and later on trying to kill him -- so Noah's motive for this is unclear). He threatens to expose Claire for bedding a student. The film tries to sell Noah to us as a "tortured soul," depicting him as the pinnacle of masculinity. Sure, he gets his comeuppance, but not in the way that Vicky does.
Vicky, the only woman who openly stands up to Noah, is humiliated by him. She tries to defend skater boy, but Noah throws her to the ground with a flick of the wrist. It's only when a male teacher interferes that Noah is able to be restrained. Later on in Vicky's office, Noah calls her a "dried-up dirty fucking cunt," and the movie doesn't even let her slap him in retaliation. Vicky plots with Claire to help her recover and destroy what I'm sure would've been the world's most awkward sex tape, but Noah is on to her, sneaking into her house and tying her up, finally taming the temptress. The audience doesn't see Vicky again until Claire discovers her as nothing more than a bound, bloodied corpse.
Really? Really, The Boy Next Door ? Did this character deserve to die for daring to be unwed in her 40s, walking around in high heels and trying to take down psychopaths? Did she have to be presented as inferior to Noah in every way, being overpowered and outsmarted by him?
The messages that this movie sends to both its male and female viewers are problematic and dangerous. I usually enjoy these types of films because they at least attempt to make an uplifting point towards the end, even that message isn't much more than "be glad you aren't them!" But I can't think of anything good that this movie is promoting.

     So, I've recently had to urge to re-read this. Admittedly, it was partially due to me watching "Troy" when I was sick this past weekend, but I also feel like there were aspects of the story that I missed while speed reading it for school and over analyzing every spear throw.  Is there anyone who's felt this and actually followed through? Was it worth it? Is there anyone out there as crazy as I feel I am right now?

1. Victory or defeat in ancient Greek wars is primarily the result of marital spats and/or petty sibling rivalry in Zeus and Hera’s dysfunctional divine household.

2. Zeus “the father of gods and men” is a henpecked husband who is also partial to domestic abuse.

3. If you take a pretty girl who is the daughter of a priest of Apollo as war booty and refuse to have her ransomed, Apollo will rain plague on your troops. And he won’t be appeased un      ...more

 TROY VI: THE INVENTION OF ACHILLES 

“The Classics, it is the Classics!” William Blake is said to have exclaimed, with pointed reference to Homer, “that Desolate Europe with Wars!”

Blake's exclamation might not be as atrocious as it sounds at first. There might be some truth to this, a universal truth.

Significantly however, this is not how the ancients understood it. They understood war as the catastrophe that it is.

Strabo, the Roman geographer, talking about the Trojan wars, puts it thus: “For it      ...more

                                       I don't know why I read this. It isn't on The List (I guess because it's technically a poem, not a novel), and it wasn't assigned reading or anything. But for whatever reason, reading The Iliad has been on my mental to-do list for a while now, and last week I finally picked it up. 

My first reaction: dude, this epic is epic. (thank you, I'll be here all week) It's full of dudes getting killed in really exquisite detail, dudes talking about killing or not killing dudes, dudes mourning dead dudes i      ...more

                                       Am I really going to bother reviewing Homer’s _Iliad_? I mean, what am I going to say that hasn’t been said by generations of scholars, reviewers or readers? Does another drop in the ocean matter? Well, even if it doesn’t I’ll give it a go I guess. Reading the _Iliad_ was mostly done by me as a correction to a perceived gap in my education. I had always known bits and pieces about the poem and its heroes from various sources and the culture in general, but I had never read the poem itself. Given      ...more

                                       When I first read The Iliad, I was way too young to fully appreciate it. I understood, of course, the backstory - a spiteful goddess is left off a wedding invitation list, she retaliates by giving the Trojan prince Paris a golden apple to reward to the best-looking goddess (because that can’t go wrong), he picks Aphrodite because she promises him the incomparably beautiful (and already married) Helen, angering the other goddesses in the process, Paris selfishly steals Helen (and a lot of treasur      ...more

Ah, the end of that sentence kinda just answered its own question, so that is one of the reasons. 

It is a classic and I think almost everyone knows at least the abridged version of The Illiad, but hey ho, it doesn't compare to original (translated by this Fagles dude) text. But all in all, I can'      ...more

Ilíada  es un poema épico extenso y arduo, repleto de descripciones de armas y combates, pero que compensa cada queja con unos pasajes sublimes y una naturalización de personajes que sorprende.

Breve reposición de argumento:  Ilíada  se concentra en la interminable ira de Aquiles, el mejor guerrero de los aqueos, a causa del robo de su botín, que i      ...more

                                       I read the Odyssey at Uni and really loved it. A romp off to parts unknown with a man who is good company from a distance. As with much of fiction, the people I am delighted to spend lots of time with on the page are not necessarily those I would want to spend anytime with otherwise.

I’ve always meant to get around to reading this. I mean, this Homer guy only wrote two books and I had enjoyed the other one, so … so, a mere twenty years later (how time flies) I got around to reading this one.

                                       UPDATE JAN 2013: I finished reading Stephen Mitchell's translation soon after the New Year and can't recommend it enough.

And, as with any good literature, I find that upon rereading the Iliad, I got something more out of it. Something that had nothing to do with my first impressions noted below (and that I'll elaborate upon more fully in my review of David Malouf's Ransom: A Novel when I finish that book).

                                       It must be said that Fagles' translation is truly a thing of beauty, measured in full to the epic course of this poem-that-begat-all-poems within the Western canon—expressively and aptly capturing the jarring, bone-splintering, sanguinary shock of men slaughtering men with bronzemongery at close quarters, the descent of the dark, whilst afire with passions personal and/or divinely-stoked; the morphic wiles and chameleon chromatism of the Olympian gods and goddesses—the latter of which strike me      ...more

                                       "Sprung out of bitterness, the philosophy of the Iliad excludes resentment." Thus Rachel Bespaloff, stating the seemingly impossible. Years ago I read the Iliad in Fitzgerald's fine translation, but every page had the heavy cadence of a "classic." Now I'm reading Fagles' and Lombardo's translations back to back, and am surprised how much I'm enjoying the poem. I don't dispute those who judge Fagles the superior translator, but for me the Lombardo version is far more stirring.

Before I start gushing praise all over this book, I can think of three things that might discourage readers from tackling The Iliad:

1. It is a very long (nearly 15,700 lines) poem. If you really don’t have a taste for poetry at all, then this may not be the book for you.

2. It is fairly violent. Lots and lots of people get spear      ...more

Achilles was born as the most highly skilled warrior of the ancient world and kings want him to fight their wars for them. The Greek gods ever intervene, playing favorites and citing specifics of class and birth and past affronts to determine on whose behalf to tip the scales episodically. Zeus is ever contravened by his wife, Hera. Apollo and Poseidon, Athene and Aphrodite have all chosen sides and seek to foil each other. The god of war, Are      ...more

The Iliad, a daunting work of fiction so genius that it has survived for thousands of years. To this day there is no modern epic which stands anywhere near it except perhaps Les Misérables or Paradise Lost. Perhaps those who are informed could add The Divine Comedy to this list, however I have not read Dante's work as of yet.

                                       This review of The Iliad is associated with the translation by Robert Fagles (1990)--

"Homer makes us Hearers, and Virgil leaves us Readers." So wrote Alexander Pope, in 1715, in the preface to his translation of The Iliad.

I have just completed reading a magnificent translation of Homer's The Iliad, and couldn't have enjoyed the experience more. I had read bits and pieces of The Iliad over the course of my life, but I had never read the entire poem from start to finish. I recently purchased the P      ...more

                                       Dear Goodreads,

Just because I want to read Butler's translation of the Iliad does not mean you need to recommend other translations to me. Note that I have already read two other editions of the Iliad. And please stop suggesting that I might want to delete one of those "duplicate" entries. 

However, if anyone HASN'T read the Iliad, there is a giveaway going on for a new translation by Peter Green: https://www.goodreads.com/giveaway/sh...

                                       Fair warning, this review probably contains spoilers. I'm not hiding it, though, because, seriously, who doesn't know what happens in The Iliad? You've got to be some kind of moron not to know this story.


So...I must be some kind of moron. I could swear I read this back in high school and/or college. I also would have bet you that I could tell you what it's about pretty dang accurately. Well here's where I would have lost that bet.

                                       This is my second time reading the Iliad, and I loved it. I came up with a routine. A few times a week, I'd walk with my wife to our favorite local, independent coffee shop (about a mile away), order a small, soy mocha, loop the Sigur Ros album () on my iPod, read one book and then walk home. It worked great. I feel as if ancient Greeks couldn't have appreciated it more. I've already started reading the Odyssey with the same routine (except with a different Sigur Ros album).

                                       I'd read The Iliad before in the Robert Fagles translation and one by Stanley Lombardo, a classics professor from the University of Kansas. But I'd always heard about the earlier Richmond Lattimore translation. It seems that whenever you read a critical work on Homer the Lattimore is quoted rather than other editions. I've frequently come across books quoting Lattimore, and recently I became interested in a critical study of Homer called The War That Killed Achilles by Caroline Alexander.

[3.5] I'd like to like the Iliad. 
It would be convenient to like the Iliad, for discussions about the canon and such. 
I like several other epic poems. I like old war films. But this? So much of it is just a bloody casualty list (pun more or less intended), plus a soap featuring the gods (sometimes amusing, depending how detached I felt). I'm sure I'd have enjoyed it a lot more in a film version where you could see movement and action; on the page      ...more

      About Homer 

                    In the Western classical tradition, Homer (Greek: Όμηρος) is considered the author of The Iliad and The Odyssey, and is revered as the greatest of ancient Greek epic poets. These epics lie at the beginning of the Western canon of literature, and have had an enormous influence on the history of literature.
When he lived is unknown. Herodotus estimates that Homer lived 400 years before his own time,      ...more

-=-=-TITLE: Pagan Gods as Demons and Spiritual Peril? - Catholic Answers Forums
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: Salvete, omnes!
(Not sure where to put this question, so please feel free to move!)
Since pagan gods are equated with demons in at least one of the psalms...
1) Am I putting myself in any spiritual peril (in the dangerous, supernatural sense) by visiting and even entering the ruins of ancient temples such as the Parthenon or Pantheon merely to admire their beauty, but, obviously, not in any way to worship the gods to whom they were dedicated? I understand that both were, at one time, made churches, so, apparently, those who made them such and worshiped God there did not believe so(?). Or, was there some kind of purification that took place before these were converted into churches? (I'm more up on the pre-Christian history of these buildings, so, if anyone could help me on these points, that would be great.) In any case, what of other temples which may not have undergone anything like this? What about gazing on pagan statues or other artistic portrayals of pagan gods? And, what about gazing upon statues of, say, Roman emperors who were deified? Especially in the latter cases, I am asking this wondering, among other things, if the demonic presence/influence still remains, say, in the temple buildings or even in/around the statues/art in some way?
2) Am I doing the same by reading, say, classical literature that makes references to pagan gods (Iliad, Odyssey, Aeneid and many others)? I think I actually read somewhere on this forum that pronouncing the names of demons can create supernatural spiritual peril, so, would pronouncing names such as those found in Graeco-Roman epic poetry result in the same? And, again, what about speaking the names of Roman emperors who were deified?
As a classicist, these issues are of particular interest to me.
On more of a side note (obviously better for an entirely new thread, but, you may wish to answer this here *briefly*), what, generally, can or cannot put one in supernatural spiritual peril, and, indeed, what does such spiritual peril involve? Or, am I completely off on this notion of supernatural spiritual peril? I just remember hearing about it off-hand on another forum post and am not really sure what Catholics do or do not believe on this matter.
Is there indeed any Church teaching on any of this?
Gratias.

Robert Fagles, winner of the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters presents us with his universally acclaimed modern verse translation of the world's greatest war story. Rage-Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus' son Achilles, murderous, doomed, that cost the Achaeans countless losses, hurling down to the House of Death so many sturdy souls? Thus begins the stirring story of the Trojan War and the rage of Achilles that has gripped listeners and readers for 2,700 years. This timeless poem still vividly conveys the horror and heroism of men and gods wrestling with towering emotions and battling amidst devastation and destruction, as it moves inexorably to its wrenching, tragic conclusion. Renowned classicist Bernard Knox observes in his superb Introduction that although the violence of the Iliad is grim and relentless, it co-exists with both images of civilized life and a poignant yearning for peace. Combining the skills of a poet and scholar, Robert Fagles brings the energy of contemporary language to this enduring heroic epic. He maintains the drive and metric music of Homer's poetry, and evokes the impact and nuance of the Iliad's mesmerizing repeated phrases in what Peter Levi calls "an astonishing performance."
@RageAgainstTheAchaean Pissed. I am so, so very pissed.
First I have to go to this beach. Then I have to kill all these dudes. And NOW – now! This prick stole my biscuit. Who does that? Am I right?
Can’t resolve this problem on my own – calling Mom!

In this widely acclaimed verse translation of Homer's great epic, Robert Fagles combines the skills of poet and scholar. He brings the energy of contemporary language to this enduring heroic work, but maintains the drive and metric music of Homer's poetry and evokes the impact and nuance of Homer's mesmerizing repeated phrases. 
“Fitzgerald has solved virtually every problem that has plagued translators of Homer. The narrative runs, the dialogue speaks, the military action is clear, and the repetitive epithets become useful text rather than exotic relics.” –Atlantic Monthly  
“Fitzgerald’s swift rhythms, bright images, and superb English make Homer live as never before…This is for every reader in our time and possibly for all time.”–Library Journal
“[Fitzgerald’s Odyssey and Iliad] open up once more the unique greatness of Homer’s art at the level above the formula; yet at the same time they do not neglect the brilliant texture of Homeric verse at the level of the line and the phrase.” –The Yale Review
 “What an age can read in Homer, what its translators can manage to say in his presence, is one gauge of its morale, one index to its system of exultations and reticences. The supple, the iridescent, the ironic, these modes are among our strengths, and among Mr. Fitzgerald’s.” –National Review
Homer was probably born around 725BC on the Coast of Asia Minor, now the coast of Turkey, but then really a part of Greece. Homer was the first Greek writer whose work survives.
He was one of a long line of bards, or poets, who worked in the oral tradition. Homer and other bards of the time could recite, or chant, long epic poems. Both works attributed to Homer – the Iliad and the Odyssey – are over ten thousand lines long in the original. Homer must have had an amazing memory but was helped by the formulaic poetry style of the time. In the IliadHomer sang of death and glory, of a few days in the struggle between the Greeks and the Trojans. Mortal men played out their fate under the gaze of the gods. The Odyssey is the original collection of tall traveller’s tales. Odysseus, on his way home from the Trojan War, encounters all kinds of marvels from one-eyed giants to witches and beautiful temptresses. His adventures are many and memorable before he gets back to Ithaca and his faithful wife Penelope.
We can never be certain that both these stories belonged to Homer. In fact ‘Homer’ may not be a real name but a kind of nickname meaning perhaps ‘the hostage’ or ‘the blind one’. Whatever the truth of their origin, the two stories, developed around three thousand years ago, may well still be read in three thousand years’ time.
Robert Fagles (1933-2008) was Arthur W. Marks ’19 Professor of Comparative Literature, Emeritus, at Princeton University. He was the recipient of the 1997 PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for Translation and a 1996 Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. His translations include Sophocles’s Three Theban Plays, Aeschylus’s Oresteia (nominated for a National Book Award), Homer’s Iliad (winner of the 1991 Harold Morton Landon Translation Award by The Academy of American Poets), Homer’s Odyssey, and Virgil's Aeneid.
Bernard Knox (1914-2010) was Director Emeritus of Harvard’s Center for Hellenic Studies in Washington, D.C. He taught at Yale University for many years. Among his numerous honors are awards from the National Institute of Arts and Letters and the National Endowment for the Humanities. His works include The Heroic Temper: Studies in Sophoclean Tragedy, Oedipus at Thebes: Sophocles’ Tragic Hero and His Time and Essays Ancient and Modern (awarded the 1989 PEN/Spielvogel-Diamonstein Award).
                                 We know very little about the author of The Odyssey and its companion tale, The Iliad. Most scholars agree that Homer was Greek; those who try to identify his origin on the basis of dialect forms in the poems tend to choose as his homeland either Smyrna, now the Turkish city known as Izmir, or Chios, an island in the eastern Aegean Sea. 
    According to legend, Homer was blind, though scholarly evidence can neither confirm nor contradict the point. 
    The ongoing debate about who Homer was, when he lived, and even if he wrote The Odyssey and The Iliad is known as the "Homeric question." Classicists do agree that these tales of the fall of the city of Troy (Ilium) in the Trojan War (The Iliad) and the aftermath of that ten-year battle (The Odyssey) coincide with the ending of the Mycenaean period around 1200 BCE (a date that corresponds with the end of the Bronze Age throughout the Eastern Mediterranean). The Mycenaeans were a society of warriors and traders; beginning around 1600 BCE, they became a major power in the Mediterranean. Brilliant potters and architects, they also developed a system of writing known as Linear B, based on a syllabary, writing in which each symbol stands for a syllable.  
         Scholars disagree on when Homer lived or when he might have written The Odyssey. Some have placed Homer in the late-Mycenaean period, which means he would have written about the Trojan War as recent history. Close study of the texts, however, reveals aspects of political, material, religious, and military life of the Bronze Age and of the so-called Dark Age, as the period of domination by the less-advanced Dorian invaders who usurped the Mycenaeans is known. But how, other scholars argue, could Homer have created works of such magnitude in the Dark Age, when there was no system of writing? Herodotus, the ancient Greek historian, placed Homer sometime around the ninth century BCE, at the beginning of the Archaic period, in which the Greeks adopted a system of writing from the Phoenicians and widely colonized the Mediterranean. And modern scholarship shows that the most recent details in the poems are datable to the period between 750 and 700 BCE.  
  No one, however, disputes the fact that The Odyssey (and The Iliad as well) arose from oral tradition. Stock phrases, types of episodes, and repeated phrases -- such as "early, rose-fingered dawn" -- bear the mark of epic storytelling. Scholars agree, too, that this tale of the Greek hero Odysseus's journey and adventures as he returned home from Troy to Ithaca is a work of the greatest historical significance and, indeed, one of the foundations of Western literature.

Chapter One  
ILIAD 1
Rage:
Sing, Goddess, Achilles' rage, Black and murderous, that cost the Greeks Incalculable pain, pitched countless souls Of heroes into Hades' dark, And left their bodies to rot as feasts For dogs and birds, as Zeus' will was done. Begin with the clash between Agamemnon— The Greek warlord—and godlike Achilles.
Which of the immortals set these two At each other's throats?
Apollo, Zeus' son and Leto's, offended By the warlord. Agamemnon had dishonored Chryses, Apollo's priest, so the god Struck the Greek camp with plague, And the soldiers were dying of it. Chryses Had come to the Greek beachhead camp Hauling a fortune for his daughter's ransom. Displaying Apollo's sacral ribbons On a golden staff, he made a formal plea To the entire Greek army, but especially The commanders, Atreus' two sons:
"Sons of Atreus and Greek heroes all: May the gods on Olympus grant you plunder Of Priam's city and a safe return home. But give me my daughter back and accept This ransom out of respect for Zeus' son, Lord Apollo, who deals death from afar."
A murmur rippled through the ranks: "Respect the priest and take the ransom." But Agamemnon was not pleased And dismissed Chryses with a rough speech:
"Don't let me ever catch you, old man, by these ships again, Skulking around now or sneaking back later. The god's staff and ribbons won't save you next time. The girl is mine, and she'll be an old woman in Argos Before I let her go, working the loom in my house And coming to my bed, far from her homeland. Now clear outof here before you make me angry!"
The old man was afraid and did as he was told. He walked in silence along the whispering surf line, And when he had gone some distance the priest Prayed to Lord Apollo, son of silken-haired Leto:
"Hear me, Silverbow, Protector of Chryse, Lord of Holy Cilla, Master of Tenedos, And Sminthian God of Plague! If ever I've built a temple that pleased you Or burnt fat thighbones of bulls and goats— Grant me this prayer: Let the Danaans pay for my tears with your arrows!"
Apollo heard his prayer and descended Olympus' crags Pulsing with fury, bow slung over one shoulder, The arrows rattling in their case on his back As the angry god moved like night down the mountain.
He settled near the ships and let loose an arrow. Reverberation from his silver bow hung in the air. He picked off the pack animals first, and the lean hounds, But then aimed his needle-tipped arrows at the men And shot until the death-fires crowded the beach.
Nine days the god's arrows rained death on the camp. On the tenth day Achilles called an assembly. Hera, the white-armed goddess, planted the thought in him Because she cared for the Greeks and it pained her To see them dying. When the troops had all mustered, Up stood the great runner Achilles, and said:
"Well, Agamemnon, it looks as if we'd better give up And sail home—assuming any of us are left alive— If we have to fight both the war and this plague. But why not consult some prophet or priest Or a dream interpreter, since dreams too come from Zeus, Who could tell us why Apollo is so angry, If it's for a vow or a sacrifice he holds us at fault. Maybe he'd be willing to lift this plague from us If he savored the smoke from lambs and prime goats."
Achilles had his say and sat down. Then up rose Calchas, son of Thestor, bird-reader supreme, Who knew what is, what will be, and what has been. He had guided the Greek ships to Troy Through the prophetic power Apollo Had given him, and he spoke out now:
"Achilles, beloved of Zeus, you want me to tell you About the rage of Lord Apollo, the Arch-Destroyer. And I will tell you. But you have to promise me and swear You will support me and protect me in word and deed. I have a feeling I might offend a person of some authority Among the Greeks, and you know how it is when a king Is angry with an underling. He might swallow his temper For a day, but he holds it in his heart until later And it all comes out. Will you guarantee my security?"
Achilles, the great runner, responded: "Don't worry. Prophesy to the best of your knowledge. I swear by Apollo, to whom you pray when you reveal The gods' secrets to the Greeks, Calchas, that while I live And look upon this earth, no one will lay a hand On you here beside these hollow ships, no, not even Agamemnon, who boasts he is the best of the Achaeans."
And Calchas, the, perfect prophet, taking courage:
"The god finds no fault with vow or sacrifice. It is for his priest, whom Agamemnon dishonored And would not allow to ransom his daughter, That Apollo deals and will deal death from afar. He will not lift this foul plague from the Greeks Until we return the dancing-eyed girl to her father Unransomed, unbought, and make formal sacrifice On Chryse. Only then might we appease the god."
He finished speaking and sat down. Then up rose Atreus' son, the warlord Agamemnon, Furious, anger like twin black thunderheads seething In his lungs, and his eyes flickered with fire As he looked Calchas up and down, and said:
"You damn soothsayer! You've never given me a good omen yet. You take some kind of perverse pleasure in prophesying Doom, don't you? Not a single favorable omen ever! Nothing good ever happens! And now you stand here Uttering oracles before the Greeks, telling us That your great ballistic god is giving us all this trouble Because I was unwilling to accept the ransom For Chryses' daughter but preferred instead to keep her In my tent! And why shouldn't I? I like her better than My wife Clytemnestra. She's no worse than her When it comes to looks, body, mind, or ability. Still, I'll give her back, if that's what's best. I don't want to see the army destroyed like this. But I want another prize ready for me right away. I'm not going to be the only Greek without a prize, It wouldn't be right. And you all see where mine is going."
And Achilles, strong, swift, and godlike:
"And where do you think, son of Atreus, You greedy glory-hound, the magnanimous Greeks Are going to get another prize for you? Do you think we have some kind of stockpile in reserve? Every town in the area has been sacked and the stuff all divided. You want the men to count it all back and redistribute it? All right, you give the girl back to the god. The army Will repay you three and four times over—when and if Zeus allows us to rip Troy down to its foundations."
The warlord Agamemnon responded:
"You may be a good man in a fight, Achilles, And look like a god, but don't try to put one over on me— It won't work. So while you have your prize, You want me to sit tight and do without? Give the girl back, just like that? Now maybe If the army, in a generous spirit, voted me Some suitable prize of their own choice, something fair— But if it doesn't, I'll just go take something myself, Your prize perhaps, or Ajax's, or Odysseus', And whoever she belongs to, it'll stick in his throat.
But we can think about that later. Right now we launch A black ship on the bright salt water, get a crew aboard, Load on a hundred bulls, and have Chryseis board her too, My girl with her lovely cheeks. And we'll want a good man For captain, Ajax or Idomeneus or godlike Odysseus— Or maybe you, son of Peleus, our most formidable hero— To offer sacrifice and appease the Arch-Destroyer for us."
Achilles looked him up and down and said:
"You shameless, profiteering excuse for a commander! How are you going to get any Greek warrior To follow you into battle again? You know, I don't have any quarrel with the Trojans, They didn't do anything to me to make me Come over here and fight, didn't run off my cattle or horses Or ruin my farmland back home in Phthia, not with all The shadowy mountains and moaning seas between. It's for you, dogface, for your precious pleasure— And Menelaus' honor—that we came here, A fact you don't have the decency even to mention! And now you're threatening to take away the prize That I sweated for and the Greeks gave me. I never get a prize equal to yours when the army Captures one of the Trojan strongholds. No, I do all the dirty work with my own hands, And when the battle's over and we divide the loot You get the lion's share and I go back to the ships With some pitiful little thing, so worn out from fighting I don't have the strength left even to complain. Well, I'm going back to Phthia now. Far better To head home with my curved ships than stay here, Unhonored myself and piling up a fortune for you."
The warlord Agamemnon responded:
"Go ahead and desert, if that's what you want! I'm not going to beg you to stay. There are plenty of others Who will honor me, not least of all Zeus the Counselor. To me, you're the most hateful king under heaven, A born troublemaker. You actually like fighting and war. If you're all that strong, it's just a gift from some god. So why don't you go home with your ships and lord it over Your precious Myrmidons. I couldn't care less about you Or your famous temper. But I'll tell you this: Since Phoebus Apollo is taking away my Chryseis, Whom I'm sending back aboard ship with my friends, I'm coming to your hut and taking Briseis, Your own beautiful prize, so that you will see just how much Stronger I am than you, and the next person will wince At the thought of opposing me as an equal."
Achilles' chest was a rough knot of pain Twisting around his heart: should he Draw the sharp sword that hung by his thigh, Scatter the ranks and gut Agamemnon, Or control his temper, repress his rage? He was mulling it over, inching the great sword From its sheath, when out of the blue Athena came, sent by the white-armed goddess Hera, who loved and watched over both men. She stood behind Achilles and grabbed his sandy hair, Visible only to him: not another soul saw her. Awestruck, Achilles turned around, recognizing Pallas Athena at once—it was her eyes— And words flew from his mouth like winging birds:
"Daughter of Zeus! Why have you come here? To see Agamemnon's arrogance, no doubt. I'll tell you where I place my bets, Goddess: Sudden death for this outrageous behavior."
Athena's eyes glared through the sea's salt haze.
"I came to see if I could check this temper of yours, Sent from heaven by the white-armed goddess Hera, who loves and watches over both of you men. Now come on, drop this quarrel, don't draw your sword. Tell him off instead. And I'll tell you, Achilles, how things will be: You're going to get Three times as many magnificent gifts Because of his arrogance. Just listen to us and be patient."
Achilles, the great runner, responded:
"When you two speak, Goddess, a man has to listen No matter how angry. It's better that way. Obey the gods and they hear you when you pray."
With that he ground his heavy hand Onto the silver hilt and pushed the great sword Back into its sheath. Athena's speech Had been well-timed. She was on her way To Olympus by now, to the halls of Zeus And the other immortals, while Achilles Tore into Agamemnon again:
"You bloated drunk, With a dog's eyes and a rabbit's heart! You've never had the guts to buckle on armor in battle Or come out with the best fighting Greeks On any campaign! Afraid to look Death in the eye, Agamemnon? It's far more profitable To hang back in the army's rear—isn't it?— Confiscating prizes from any Greek who talks back And bleeding your people dry. There's not a real man Under your command, or this latest atrocity Would be your last, son of Atreus. Now get this straight. I swear a formal oath: By this scepter, which will never sprout leaf Or branch again since it was cut from its stock In the mountains, which will bloom no more Now that bronze has pared off leaf and bark, And which now the sons of the Greeks hold in their hands At council, upholding Zeus' laws— By this scepter I swear: When every last Greek desperately misses Achilles, Your remorse won't do any good then, When Hector the man-killer swats you down like flies. And you will eat your heart out Because you failed to honor the best Greek of all."
Those were his words, and he slammed the scepter, Studded with gold, to the ground and sat down.
Opposite him, Agamemnon fumed. Then Nestor Stood up, sweet-worded Nestor, the orator from Pylos With a voice high-toned and liquid as honey. He had seen two generations of men pass away In sandy Pylos and was now king in the third. He was full of good will in the speech he made:
"It's a sad day for Greece, a sad day. Priam and Priam's sons would be happy indeed, And the rest of the Trojans too, glad in their hearts, If they learned all this about you two fighting, Our two best men in council and in battle. Now you listen to me, both of you. You are both Younger than I am, and I've associated with men Better than you, and they didn't treat me lightly. I've never seen men like those, and never will, The likes of Peirithous and Dryas, a shepherd to his people, Caineus and Exadius and godlike Polyphemus, And Aegeus' son, Theseus, who could have passed for a god, The strongest men who ever lived on earth, the strongest, And they fought with the strongest, with wild things From the mountains, and beat the daylights out of them. I was their companion, although I came from Pylos, From the ends of the earth—they sent for me themselves. And I held my own fighting with them. You couldn't find A mortal on earth who could fight with them now. And when I talked in council, they took my advice. So should you two now: taking advice is a good thing. Agamemnon, for all your nobility, don't take his girl. Leave her be: the army originally gave her to him as a prize. Nor should you, son of Peleus, want to lock horns with a king. A scepter-holding king has honor beyond the rest of men, Power and glory given by Zeus himself. You are stronger, and it is a goddess who bore you. But he is more powerful, since he rules over more. Son of Atreus, cease your anger. And I appeal Personally to Achilles to control his temper, since he is, For all Greeks, a mighty bulwark in this evil war."
And Agamemnon, the warlord:
"Yes, old man, everything you've said is absolutely right. But this man wants to be ahead of everyone else, He wants to rule everyone, give orders to everyone, Lord it over everyone, and he's not going to get away with it. If the gods eternal made him a spearman, does that mean They gave him permission to be insolent as well?"
And Achilles, breaking in on him:
"Ha, and think of the names people would call me If I bowed and scraped every time you opened your mouth. Try that on somebody else, but not on me. I'll tell you this, and you can stick it in your gut: I'm not going to put up a fight on account of the girl. You, all of you, gave her and you can all take her back. But anything else of mine in my black sailing ship You keep your goddamn hands off, you hear? Try it. Let everybody here see how fast Your black blood boils up around my spear."
So it was a stand-off, their battle of words, And the assembly beside the Greek ships dissolved. Achilles went back to the huts by his ships With Patroclus and his men. Agamemnon had a fast ship Hauled down to the sea, picked twenty oarsmen, Loaded on a hundred bulls due to the god, and had Chryses' daughter, His fair-cheeked girl, go aboard also. Odysseus captained, And when they were all on board, the ship headed out to sea.
Onshore, Agamemnon ordered a purification. The troops scrubbed down and poured the filth Into the sea. Then they sacrificed to Apollo Oxen and goats by the hundreds on the barren shore. The smoky savor swirled up to the sky.
That was the order of the day. But Agamemnon Did not forget his spiteful threat against Achilles. He summoned Talthybius and Eurybates, Faithful retainers who served as his heralds:
"Go to the hut of Achilles, son of Peleus; Bring back the girl, fair-cheeked Briseis. If he won't give her up, I'll come myself With my men and take her—and freeze his heart cold."
It was not the sort of mission a herald would relish. The pair trailed along the barren seashore Until they came to the Myrmidons' ships and encampment. They found Achilles sitting outside his hut Beside his black ship. He was not glad to see them. They stood respectfully silent, in awe of this king, And it was Achilles who was moved to address them first:
 "Welcome, heralds, the gods' messengers and men's. Come closer. You're not to blame, Agamemnon is, Who sent you here for the girl, Briseis.

Notes
  The Genealogy of the Royal House of Troy Textual Variants from the Oxford Classical Text Notes on the Translation Suggestions for Further Reading Pronouncing Glossary
Robert Fagles's translation of Homer's Iliad is spiritually if not literally true to the original. Both versions repeat set speeches and descriptions in precisely the same words, and the translation exhibits a fairly regular rhythmic beat. But Homer's Greek was chanted, and the set passages were like refrains in which listeners could, if they chose, join in as a chorus. In English, the repetitions sometimes become tedious, especially when the same speech is given three times in two pages, as in the relay of Zeus's orders in Book II. Especially noteworthy is Bernard Knox's long and fascinating Introduction, a masterpiece of literary criticism which conveys Homer's grim attitude toward war, the interplay of divine and human will, and the ancient concepts of honor, courage, and virility in the face of the stark finality of death. Knox also includes a succinct explanation of the quantitative, rather than accentual, basis of Greek (and Latin) verse. For easy readability, Fagles's translation is without rival. For elegance and poetry, however, I recommend Richmond Lattimore's older but still gripping and fluent translation.
The Nook version of this title is rife with errors -- for anyone out there that is thinking of buying Fagles' transation of the Iliad for the Nook, DO NOT BUY! Penguin's disrespect for the reputation of their house, together with their decision to sell this ebook to consumers WITHOUT EVEN PROOFREADING IT is shameful. This is a seminal work of epic poetry, part of the foundation of our Western literary tradition. An example: "You fool" is "You foot", "corn" becomes "com", lowercase L's replace exclamation points, and quotation marks go in the wrong direction. Shame on Penguin, and shame on Barnes and Noble for not providing a feedback link for poorly formatted ebooks. B&N, take this title down immediately, until Penguin reviews it. B&N is charging $14 for this? An outrage.
"Achilles doesn't gladly suffer fools, 
and Agamemnon's foolishness is shown 
when he takes away Briseis and rules 
proudly, claiming war prizes for his own 
which should, by rights, belong to other men 
(the slavery issue never gets addressed) 
but this king of all the Greeks is brought low when 
Achilles boycotts battle. Since their best 
and boldest fighter's sitting out, the Greeks 
are getting hacked to bits by Hector, who's 
just fighting for his home, but then Zeus speaks,  
and brings down Trojan doom: they're going to lose. 
The Greeks march ahead with inexorable forces 
and Troy buries Hector, the breaker of horses." 
Here we have the story of the fall of Troy at the hands of the Greeks, though The Iliad actually ends before the fall of Troy, the Trojan Horse comes along in a later book, The Odyssey, and the Greeks are usually called Achaeans or Argives (I think what they're called at any given point has something to do with Homer's metrics and how many syllables his lines needed). The half-god warrior Achilles is the central figure of the story and the action is driven as much by his decisions as it is by the whims of the gods, who take sides in the war and vigorously defend their favorite champions. Achilles meets his opposite in Hector, prince of Troy, who is a family man fighting to defend his own home city, while Achilles is in it for the glory and is fighting for a man he hates. Hector kills Achilles' friend Patroclus, Achilles kills Hector in retaliation, and the war-cycle spirals downward and gets uglier with each passing skirmish. 
Some themes: 
Rage: The Iliad is called the epic of menis, rage, the first chapter is titled "The Wrath of Achilles," and the first (and best) line in the whole epic is, "Rage-Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus' son Achilles." This killing-anger isn't something the characters can escape from for any length of time. Rage can be hidden, but it always eventually bursts forth again--Achilles even nurtures the feeling. He's furious and refuses to fight for the Achaeans, and then when they bring him presents to appease him, he ain't want to be appeased! Cooler heads don't seem to prevail, here, and the epidemic of rage ensures that The Iliad is endlessly violent and gory--except for Hector's body, which is preserved from decay by the gods, the other casualties of war either get thrown onto pyres or become food for the vultures. 
Vengeance. An eye for an eye, ad infinitum. Humans love seeking vengeance, like Achilles avenging Patroclus by killing Hector, but the gods are fond of it, too. The gods are big on damage control--they might not be able to stop you from doing something disastrous, but they'll certainly punish you for it after the fact, like Apollo visiting the Achaeans with a plague after they kidnap Chryseis, the daughter of his priest. 
Doom. Not just fate, but negative fate. Doom hangs over all of Troy and over most of the Achaens that the reader might actually care about: though Achilles is a killing machine, it's possible to empathize with him, and the propheices make it clear that he's going to die at Troy; Odysseus is going to live through the war, but it'll be another long decade before he gets home; Agamemnon is going to be murdered by his wife's boyfriend when he gets home (but since he's a power-hungry tyrant who killed his own daughter, it's not such a loss), and Menelaus is going to regain Helen and go home, but you can't say they'll live at all h
To be claimed...
This was actually a gift for my son.  He absolutely loved it! He has read the odyssey and I just sent him the third book in this series.  He feels that everyone should read these books. Thank you so much!
This is a great version of the classic epic poem, by an excellent translator, and with tremendously helpful additional materials, especially the introduction!  I highly recommend all of Fagles translations of classical Greek literature!
I had to read this book for my Literature class and I thought I was gonna die, especially seeing how thick the book was. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down. This book translates the events well and the read was easy. Would definitely advise you to read.
 Do not buy this for an english class
If you n eed this...order from somewhere else.  B&amp;N cancelled my order because it is out of stock and didn't notify me.   Website says it  is available and normally ships within 24 hours.  :(  I needed this for school.  Very disappointed in B&amp;N customer service.
This translation of the  Iliad is a great read. Start with  the  poem ,. Read   the   
forward later, if at all.
Mr. Fagles' translation of the iliad is PERFECT!!!  WARNING: May cause severe bewilderment; Has a natural aptitude for adventure!
Fagles retains the poetic beauty of Homer's original tale while keeping the grittiness intact.
I read this last year as a high school freshman and thought it was quite good. This transalation is much less boring than others.
I didnt enjoy this book one bit. I had to read it for high school and just finished it. It was very difficult to understand and I dont think anyone should make themselves read it for fun. If you want to know the plotline which isnt very bad then go to sparknotes for a good lengthy description and analysis. WARNING: Reading may cause drowsiness and exaustion. Also some cases of distress and axiety. Not reccomended for most readers.
Came quickly, my Kid was excited and really enjoyed the book
A classic masterpiece. Great violence! It's the true art of war...when war was up close and personal. This is where Hollywood comes for their great action blockbusters. Spies, Emotional struggles, violence, war...all that in  the fantasy of the gods. Really good reading
This is the original Superhero story.  Though previous translations from the ancient Greek were dry, and by many accounts, almost unreadable, this one is gorgeous.  Fagle's translation reads like prose.  And a great introduction by Bernard Knox helps with context and history.  Highly recommended.
My son and I tried making it through the recommended Lattimore translation with a guide and almost stopped reading the Iliad all together.  We are sooo glad we gave Fagles a try!!  This is an amazing story, told using a wonderful translation.  Can't wait for the Odyssey!
i loved the translation of this story and the language flows nicely. I stayed captivated the entire time. My ten year old brother had a hard time reading it though, it would be dificult for anyone younger than twelve. A definate must read for everyone.
This translation of one of the most important pieces of international literature is surely one of the best. The language flows and the story is vivid to your imagination. I recommend this version to anyone who wants the truth behink Troy

-=-=-TITLE: Pagan Gods as Demons and Spiritual Peril? - Catholic Answers Forums
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: Quote: : Salvete, omnes!
(Not sure where to put this question, so please feel free to move!)
Since pagan gods are equated with demons in at least one of the psalms...
1) Am I putting myself in any spiritual peril (in the dangerous, supernatural sense) by visiting and even entering the ruins of ancient temples such as the Parthenon or Pantheon merely to admire their beauty, but, obviously, not in any way to worship the gods to whom they were dedicated? I understand that both were, at one time, made churches, so, apparently, those who made them such and worshiped God there did not believe so(?). Or, was there some kind of purification that took place before these were converted into churches? (I'm more up on the pre-Christian history of these buildings, so, if anyone could help me on these points, that would be great.) In any case, what of other temples which may not have undergone anything like this? What about gazing on pagan statues or other artistic portrayals of pagan gods? And, what about gazing upon statues of, say, Roman emperors who were deified? Especially in the latter cases, I am asking this wondering, among other things, if the demonic presence/influence still remains, say, in the temple buildings or even in/around the statues/art in some way?
2) Am I doing the same by reading, say, classical literature that makes references to pagan gods (Iliad, Odyssey, Aeneid and many others)? I think I actually read somewhere on this forum that pronouncing the names of demons can create supernatural spiritual peril, so, would pronouncing names such as those found in Graeco-Roman epic poetry result in the same? And, again, what about speaking the names of Roman emperors who were deified?
As a classicist, these issues are of particular interest to me.
On more of a side note (obviously better for an entirely new thread, but, you may wish to answer this here *briefly*), what, generally, can or cannot put one in supernatural spiritual peril, and, indeed, what does such spiritual peril involve? Or, am I completely off on this notion of supernatural spiritual peril? I just remember hearing about it off-hand on another forum post and am not really sure what Catholics do or do not believe on this matter.
Is there indeed any Church teaching on any of this?
Gratias.

-=-=-TEXT: In this                link, you will find images illustrating the ILIAD. Most of these                come from vasepainting (usually "Attic," i.e. the area                around and including Athens) and date from 550-300 BCE. This is                roughly 200 to 500 years after most scholars think the epics were                first committed to writing. In many instances, the vasepainters                do not represent "accurately" what our text of Homer says--they                combine scenes, add characters, etc. They also create very unplausible                compositions for the sake of visual interest, like two heroes fighting                naked, except for shields, because their naked bodies are more interesting                to look at. All the same, vasepainting kept the myths from Homer                constantly before the eyes of Athenians--and other Greek and non-Greek                speaking peoples around the Mediterranean--e.g. the Etruscans (many                of our best examples of Attic vasepainting were found in Etruria,                in north-central Italy).
The site                of Troy as depicted by Schliemann's painter, William Simpson, in                1877, before Schliemann began "excavating." In the foreground,                two Turkish gentlemen share a conversation, while in the background,                Schliemann shows ruins to visitors. In this case, the ruins are                those of Hellenistic and Roman buildings on top of the Bronze Age                mound.
An aerial                view of Troy as it is now, after a century of excavation. The result                of Schliemann's first excavation, the "great trench" carved                into the upper central part of the mound, is still visible. While                his early methods were crude and destroyed a lot of valuable data,                Schliemann did learn as he went, and later excavators (especially                Carl Blegen) were able to piece together the complex history of                Troy, which contained many levels and sub-levels. Bronze Age culture                at Troy shared many similarities with that of mainland Greece, and                we should probably imagine a decorated, fortified palace comparable                to Mycenae or Tiryns as "Homer's" Troy.
The Trojan                war had multiple causes--primarily, the theft of Helen after the                judgement of Paris, but also (as a source of Hera's rage against                Troy) the theft of Ganymede, a Trojan prince, a generation before                to be Zeus' "cupbearer." In an Attic red-figure vase (c450                BCE), Zeus pursues Ganymede on one side, while Ganymede runs away,                rolling along a hoop and carrying a cock (presumably a courtship                gift from Zeus). As often happens, the vasepainter has overlapped                his depiction of a mythological story with common behaviors (in                this case, homoerotic courtship rituals) in classical Athens.
This                fragment of an Attic red-figure vase shows Peleus raping Thetis,                an act approved by Zeus after he discovered (from Prometheus) the                name of the goddess destined to have a son greater than his father.                Thetis resisted by assuming multiple shapes (sea gods and goddesses                have this power). The painter has depicted a lion coming out of                her arm to bite Peleus' back, a snake curling up around his leg,                and sea-serpent jumping out of Thetis' other leg.
Peleus                and Thetis were subsequently married, a gala event to which all                the Olympian gods were invited (except one). This Attic red-figure                amphora shows the gods escorting Thetis to the marriage chamber:                top left, Dionysus and Semele (?); top right, Apollo (with the lyre)                and Artemis; bottom left, Hermes escorts the bride while Zeus and                Hera hold torches; bottom right, Peleus sits on the marriage couch                awaiting his bride.
The one                goddess NOT invited, of course, was Eris (Strife), who rolled in                an apple inscribed, "for the fairest." Hera, Athena, and                Aphrodite claimed it, and Zeus wisely appointed a mortal, Paris,                to be the judge. This Attic red-figure crater (c420 BCE) shows Paris                seated on a rock between the three goddesses (Hera with the mirror,                Athena with the spear and helmet, and Aphrodite behind him, pulling                her dress open...guess which one will win?).
A Roman                wall painting of the same theme, with Hermes in the right background.                Aphrodite, in the center, seems determined to win, and she has offered                Paris the world's most beautiful woman (Helen).
Paris                chose Aphrodite and abducted Helen from her husband, Menelaus, the                king of Sparta. Menelaus' brother was Agamemnon, the king of Mycenae--the                most powerful bronze age city in Greece. The brothers formed a coalition                of Greek heroes (the famous 1000 ships), and attacked Troy. The                coalition was fragile, politically, as was shown when Chryses, a                priest of Apollo, came to the Greek ships to ransom his daughter,                Chryseis. Despite the army's shout of approval, Agamemnon refused.                This red-figure Apulian vase (from southern Italy), c375-350 BCE,                shows Chryses on his knees before Agamemnon, making his request.                Achilles sits in the background, examining his helmet.
Apollo                sent a plague to punish the Greeks for refusing Chryses' request.                When the seer, Calchas, said the plague would be removed only if                Chryseis was returned, Agamemnon demanded another prize from the                army...Achilles pointed out that there was no pile of booty lying                around...Agamemnon then declared that he would just go and take                some other hero's war prize...even Achilles'. This mosaic from Pompeii                (VI 7 23), c70 CE, shows Achilles rising and drawing his sword,                the moment when Athena descends from Olympus and takes him by the                hair.
Despite                Nestor's good advice, Agamemnon made good his threat, sending the                heralds to take Briseis. In this Attic red-figure cup (c480 BCE),                they lead Briseis away to the left, while Achilles sits in his tent,                wrapped up in anger and grief. Two bearded figures watch with sympathy;                the one behind Achilles may be Patroclus.
After                one-on-one combat with Menelaus in book 3, in which he is almost                throttled by his own chinstrap, Paris is rescued by Aphrodite and                whisked back to his bedroom in Troy. Aphrodite then leads Helen                (despite her resistance) to go to bed with him. In this Attic red-figure                vase (c430 BCE), Helen demurely approaches Paris, who still holds                two spears.
In book                4, the truce is broken when Pandaros (at the instigation of Athena)                wounds Menalaus with an arrow. The fighting resumes, and in book                5 Diomedes takes control (his aristeia), slaughtering many Trojans.                This illustrated manuscript from Milan (5-6th century CE) shows                Diomedes (top register, center) being urged on by Athena (lower                right) as he tramples his way over a carpet of bodies. In the lower                register (lower right corner), Diomedes has been shot in the shoulder                with an arrow, and Athena comes close to breath strength back into                him.
Diomedes                rages on! In this Attic red-figure Crater (c480 BCE), he wounds                Aeneas in the hip (with a spear, not a rock as in the ILIAD), and                Aphrodite grabs hold to rescue her son.
In book                6, Hector runs back into the city to tell the Trojan women to pray                to Athena to turn aside Diomedes. Meanwhile, Diomedes runs into                Glaucus on the battlefield. After discovering that their fathers                had a guest-host relationship, they agree not to fight each other                and exchange armor. This calyx crater, Athenian red-figure (c490                BCE) shows the exchange. It is damaged, however, some just some                fragments of the bodies are visible...no one has really been beheaded.
Toward                the end of book 6, Hector runs into his wife, Andromache, as he                prepares to leave the city. This Apulian red-figure vase (c350 BCE)                shows Hector reaching out for his infant son, Astyanax, after taking                off his helmet.
In book                7, as the first day of fighting draws to a close, Hector challenges                the Greeks to single combat. At first they don't respond, but after                a pep-talk from Nestor, the main heroes volunteer. Ajax's lot is                chosen, and in this Attic red-figure cup (c470 BCE), this combat                is rather impressionistically shown, with Ajax wounding Hector in                the ribs with a spear at the same time that a rock flies through                the air between them. Athena supports Ajax, while Apollo supports                Hector.
After                a day of fighting in book 8, in which the Greeks lose pretty badly,                Agamemnon agrees at the beginning of book 9 that he made a mistake                taking away Achilles' girl, Briseis. He promises an enormous list                of prizes to persuade Achilles back into the war, and Odysseus,                Ajax, and Phoenix are sent to deliver his message, and to soothe                and convince Achilles--without success. This scene from the neck                of an Attic red-figure hydria (water jug), c470 BCE, shows Achilles                wrapped up in dismay listening to Odysseus.
Fighting                resumes in book 11, and after Agamemnon has his aristeia and is                driven from the field by a wound to his elbow, Diomedes again takes                the lead. He bounces a spear off of Hector's helmet, but this Attic                black-figure amphora (c520 BCE) shows them fighting at close quarters,                over a body labelled "SKYTHES," a name that is not found                in the ILIAD.
Another                confused scene of fighting from book 11 (apparently). Diomedes is                at center left, stabbing a Trojan named Charops (on one knee). Charops                is defended from behind by Hippolochus. At center right, Glaucus                fights Menestheus, and behind Menestheus, Odysseus steps up on the                body of a Trojan named "ME..." The vase combines names                and episodes from different points in book 11 (e.g., in our ILIAD,                Charops is killed by Odysseus AFTER Diomedes has already been wounded                in the foot and withdrawn).
After                the seduction of Zeus by Hera in book 14, Hector rejoins the combat                in book 15, and the Greeks are driven back inside their wall. Ajax                is the only hero holding off Hector as he tries to burn the boats.                This Attic black-figure amphora (c530 BCE) shows Ajax and Hector                locked in single combat.
Making                good Nestor's fateful suggestion in book 11, Patroclus returns to                Achilles' tent at the beginning of book 16 and asks that he give                him his armor and troops, so that he can rescue the Greeks, whose                ships Hector is beginning to burn. Achilles agrees, and Patroclus                sweeps the Trojans back, killing one of their best heroes, Zeus'                son Poseidon. While he was unable to keep him alive, Zeus does protect                his body, sending Apollo down to lift take the body--which he then                gives to Sleep and Death to take to home to Lycia. This Attic red-figure                crater has Hermes standing over the body as it is lifted by Sleep                and Death directly, and Apollo does not appear.
Patroclus'                own death at the hands of Apollo, Euphorbus, and Hector, follows                quickly after Sarpedon's, at the end of book 16. Book 17 consists                entirely of grim, nightmarish combat over his body, until it is                finally taken by the Greeks in book 18, after Achilles finally appears                and screams at the Trojans. This red-figure crater from Sicily (c500                BCE) shows, covered in a starry mantle, lifted off the field.
Achilles,                of course, has lost his armor, since Hector stripped Patroclus'                (Achilles') away and put it on himself during book 17. In book 18,                Thetis visits Hephaistos and asks him to forge new, and spectacular,                armor for Achilles. This black-figure Attic amphora (c540 BCE) shows                Thetis handing Hephaistos' creation over to Achilles. You can see                that the painter did not try to capture in miniature the intricate                description of the shield in book 18 of the ILIAD.
With              his new weapons and his rage over the death of Patroclus, Achilles              (after being forced by Odysseus in book 19 to accept the gifts promised              by Agamemnon) slaughters the Trojans without mercy in books 20 and              21, eventually provoking the river-god Skamander (Xanthus) to attack              him. After Xanthus is boiled into submission by Hephaistos, and being              led on a short goosechase by Apollo disguised as Agenor, Achilles              finally faces Hector in single combat in 22. In this Attic red-figure              cup (c480 BCE), Hector breaks his spear on Achilles' shield, and Achilles              advances with drawn sword--again, different from the ILIAD, where              Hector advances with drawn sword and is stabbed by Achilles with a              spear in the throat. On the right you see Apollo turning to abandon              his hero.                          
Having                killed Hector, Achilles pokes holes through his ankles and drags                him across the battlefield to the Greek camp, where he repeatedly                drags Hector around Patroclus' body. This red-figure Apulian volute                crater shows 1) Achilles dragging Hector's body, and 2) at the funeral                pyre of Patroclus (here represented as an altar), slitting the throats                of the 12 Trojan princes he captured in book 21 at the river Xanthus.
Despite                his rage, Achilles is persuaded by his mother, Thetis, to return                the body of Hector to Priam in book 24. In this Attic red-figure                Hydria (c470 BCE), the aged Priam approaches Achilles, who, thanks                to the help of Hermes, doesn't see him coming. The body of Hector,                with its many wounds, lies unrotting (thanks to Aphrodite's ambrosia                treatment) under his couch.

-=-=-TEXT: REGIONAL PREMIERE. The ancient thrilling tales of the Trojan War and the modern world collide in this captivating theatrical experience as we explore the psychology of passion and rage. Acclaimed Cincinnati actor Bruce Cromer embodies the Greek classic's famous characters Achilles, Hector, Agammemnon—even the beautiful Helen of Troy—as he shares the stage with only a virtuoso musician. This lean, muscular, tour-de-force performance conjures the fury of the gods as it delves deep into mankind’s unshakeable attraction to violence, destruction, and chaos.

-=-=-TITLE:  The Iliad By Homer About the Iliad - CliffsNotes
-=-=-SNIPPET:  Introduction to the Poem. The Iliad deals with only a small portion of the Trojan War; in fact, it covers only a few months during the tenth year of that war.
-=-=-TEXT: The Iliad deals with only a small portion of the Trojan War; in fact, it covers only a few months during the tenth year of that war. The ancient Greek audience, however, would have been familiar with all the events leading up to this tenth year, and during the course of the Iliad, Homer makes many references to various past events.
The story of the Iliad has its actual beginning in the creation of the great wall at Troy. The Trojans enlisted the aid of the sea god, Poseidon, to help build the wall. However, after the wall was constructed, Poseidon demanded his just compensation, but the Trojans reneged. Consequently, Troy was without divine protection and, in fact, Poseidon became its enemy.
At the time of the Trojan war, Troy was ruled by King Priam, who was married to Hekuba. According to legend, Priam and Hekuba had forty-nine children, including the warrior Hektor, the prophetess Cassandra, and the young lover, Paris (also known as Alexandros). Deiphobus is also one of the children of Priam and Hekuba.
When Hekuba was pregnant with Paris, she had a dream that Paris would be the cause of the destruction of Troy. An oracle and a seer confirmed that this son would indeed be the cause of the total destruction of the noble city of Troy. Therefore, for the sake of the city, Hekuba agreed to abandon her newborn infant to die by exposure on Mount Ida, but Paris was saved by shepherds and grew up as a shepherd, ignorant of his royal birth.
On the Greek side, the story of the Iliad begins with the wedding of Peleus, a mortal, and Thetis, a goddess. These two become the parents of Achilles. At their wedding, Eris, the goddess of strife, throws down a golden apple with the message, "For the Fairest." Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite all try to claim the prize, and no god, including Zeus, is willing to resolve the dispute.
After a long conference on Mount Ida, Paris, the poor but royal shepherd is chosen to be the judge of the dispute between the three goddesses. They all offer bribes to Paris. Hera offers him rule over all of Asia. Athena offers victory in battle and supreme wisdom. But Aphrodite, knowing her man, offers the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen, wife of Menelaos, the ruler of Sparta. Paris proclaims Aphrodite the fairest of all and anticipates his prize.
The initiation of strife, in the form of Eris and her apple, at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, introduces an idea that runs throughout the Iliad. Strife, metaphorically embodied in a goddess in the legend, is the motivating factor in most of the major events in the epic. Strife provokes the war. Strife with Agamemnon over a slave girl causes Achilles to withdraw from battle. Strife between various groups and individuals sharpens the action of the poem. Finally, the resolution of strife provides an ending for the poem. Eris is rarely mentioned in the Iliad, but her presence is almost palpable.
Before going to the court of Menelaos to secure Helen, Paris establishes his legitimacy as a son of King Priam of Troy. Only then does Paris travel to Sparta, where for ten days he is treated royally as the guest of Menelaos and Helen. After ten days, Menelaos has to travel to Crete to conduct business. In Menelaos' absence, Paris abducts Helen and returns with her to Troy. Various accounts of this event make Helen either a willing accomplice to Paris' scheme or a resisting victim of kidnapping. In the Iliad, Helen's constant references to herself as a bitch and prostitute leave little doubt that Homer sees her as a culpable accomplice in the abduction.
Word of Helen's abduction reaches Menelaos in Crete. He immediately goes to his brother, Agamemnon, the great ruler of Mycenae. At first the two brothers try diplomacy with Troy to secure the return of Helen. When that fails, they determine to enlist the aid of many other rulers of small Greek kingdoms. Nestor of Pylos, an old friend of the family, accompanies Menelaos as he goes to each state seeking support. The Greek army that Menelaos and Nestor help assemble represents the Greek or Mycenaean notion of reciprocity. Actions were performed with the expectation of a reciprocal action. According to some accounts, the various Greek rulers had all courted Helen and felt an obligation to Menelaos. But, even so, they go on the raid with an understanding that they will receive a share of the booty that will come from the destruction of Troy and other nearby states. In fact, the opening dispute between Agamemnon and Achilles is over what they each see as inequity in the distribution of their war prizes.
Some of the Greek leaders were anxious to sack Troy; but two, Odysseus and Achilles, were warned by the oracles of their fates if they participated in the war. Odysseus was warned that his journey home would last twenty years, and thus he feigned madness; but his ruse was quickly discovered and he finally agreed to go to war. The Greeks knew that they could never capture Troy without the help of Achilles, who was the greatest warrior in the world. He was practically invulnerable as a fighter, because at birth his mother dipped him in the River Styx, rendering him immortal everywhere except in the heel, where she held him. (Later, Paris discovers this vulnerability and shoots a poisoned arrow into Achilles' heel — thus, we have the term "Achilles' heel," meaning one's vulnerability.) Achilles was warned that if he went to war he would gain great glory, but he would die young. His mother then disguised him in women's clothing, but the sly Odysseus discovered the trick and Achilles finally consented to go.
After a few months, the Greek army gathers at Aulis in Euboea. According to some accounts, they immediately launch an attack on Teuthrania, an ally of Troy, are defeated, and are driven back. Much of the army disperses. During this same period, the prophet Kalchas predicts that ten years will pass before the walls of Troy will fall. The Greeks, or Achaians as they called themselves, do not try a mass attack on Troy again for about eight years. They have not, as many imagine, spent nine years beneath the walls of Troy, as when the Iliad opens. Some scholars consider this first expedition story to be a variant account of the more common story, but many others think that the expedition against Troy was actually made up of two widely separated expeditions.
The story of the second (or possibly first) assembly at Aulis is the more famous account. At this assembly of the Achaian forces, they are unable to sail because of onshore winds. This time Kalchas reports that Artemis, Goddess of the Hunt, is offended because Agamemnon killed a deer sacred to her. The only way the Achaians can leave is by Agamemnon's sacrifice of his daughter, Iphigeneia, to Artemis. Agamemnon tricks Iphigeneia by telling her that she is to wed Achilles. When she arrives for her wedding, she is gagged so that she cannot pronounce a dying curse, and sacrificed to Artemis. The winds shift, and the Achaians (Greeks) sail for Troy.
The Achaians land at a protected shore near Troy. They build a wall of earth, stone, and timber to protect their ships. This wall is the focus of the Trojan attack in Books XII and XIII. After the construction of the wall, the Achaians begin their siege of Troy. Some of their forces raid nearby states. Achilles attacks cities to the south while Telamonian Aias (Ajax) takes Teuthrania.
A year later, the tenth year since the original prediction by Kalchas, all of the Achaians assemble near Troy to begin what they hope will be the final assault. Here is where the Iliad begins as a feud develops between Achilles and Agamemnon. The poem recounts the events of this feud as they take place over several days. The epic ends with the death and burial of the Trojan warrior, Hektor.
The events after the Iliad that lead to the fall of Troy are not a part of the poem. After the burial of Hektor, the Trojans call on outside forces for help, and the Greeks lose many warriors. In one battle, Achilles encounters Paris, who shoots an arrow that, guided by Apollo, strikes Achilles in the right heel, the only place where he is vulnerable. Aias (Ajax) and Odysseus are able, with great difficulty, to rescue Achilles' body, and immediately there arises a dispute over who should receive Achilles' splendid armor. When it is awarded to Odysseus, Aias (Ajax) becomes so furious that he threatens to kill some of the Greek leaders. When he realizes the lack of honor in his threats, he commits suicide.
With the death of their two greatest and most valiant warriors, Aias and Achilles, the Greeks become anxious about ever taking Troy. After consulting various seers and oracles, they are instructed to secure the bow and arrows of Heracles, which are in the hands of Prince Philoctetes, a Greek who was abandoned earlier because of a loathsome wound that would not heal. Odysseus and Diomedes are sent to Philoctetes, and they convince him to return with the bow and arrows. In his first encounter in battle, he is able to kill Paris. This death, however, does not affect the course of the war.
The Greeks are then given a series of tasks that they must accomplish to secure victory: They must bring the bones of Pelops back to Greece from Asia, bring Achilles' son into the war, and steal the sacred image of Athena from the Trojan sanctuary. These tasks are accomplished, but none of them changes the course of the war. Then Odysseus conceives a plan whereby the Greeks can get inside the walls of Troy: A great horse of wood is constructed with a hollow belly that can hold many warriors. In the darkness of night, the horse is brought to the Trojan plain. Odysseus and some of his men are hidden inside the horse. The rest of the Achaians burn their camps and sail off behind a nearby island.
The next morning, the Trojans find the Greeks gone and the huge, mysterious horse sitting before Troy. They also discover a Greek named Sinon, whom they take captive. Odysseus provided Sinon with plausible stories about the Greek departure, the wooden horse, and his own presence there to tell the Trojans. Sinon tells Priam and the others that Athena deserted the Greeks because of the theft of her image from her temple. Without her help, they were lost and so they departed. But to get home safely, they had to have a human sacrifice. Sinon was chosen, but he escaped and hid. The horse was left to placate the angry goddess, and the Greeks hoped the Trojans would desecrate it, earning Athena's hatred. These lies convince Priam and many other Trojans, so they pull the gigantic horse inside the gates to honor Athena.
That night, the soldiers creep out of the horse, kill the sentries, and open the gates to let the Achaian army in. The Achaians set fires throughout the city, massacre the inhabitants, and loot the city. The Trojan resistance is ineffectual. King Priam is killed, and by morning all but a few Trojans are dead. Only Aeneas, with his old father, his young son, and a small band of Trojans, escape. Hektor's young son, Astyanax, is thrown from the walls of the city. The women who are left are given to the Greek leaders as war prizes, to be used as slaves or as concubines. Troy is devastated. Hera and Athena have their revenge upon Paris and upon his city.

 The older of the two surviving ancient Greek epic poems, traditionally ascribed to Homer but containing material composed orally over several centuries. It begins with the wrathful withdrawal of the Greek hero Achilles from the fighting in the Trojan War and ends after his return to slay the Trojan hero Hector.
He was so fond of these stories that while still a little boy he made a play from the Iliad which was acted by the boys of one of his schools.

-=-=-TEXT: Iliad, (Song of Ilion; Song of Ilium) this epic Homeric poem tells the story of the Trojan War and the battle of Troy (Ilium), one of the most important and well-known events in Greek mythology when the gods still visited mortals. It tells of Achilles, leader of the Achaeans and his great wrath towards King Agamemnon, leader of the Greeks. Narrated by one informed by the Muses, it includes other such important Achaean and Trojan figures as Zeus, Patroclus, Diomed, Ajax, Menelaus, Hector, Hecuba, Helen, Paris, and Aeneas. Iliad is a glorification of war and the bravery of Achilles, demi-god and great military warrior.
A war started over a single fruit. This is where the tale of the Iliad began. It developed over time to become one of the great epics of our society, one that many people all over the world have come to like, sympathizing for each of the characters. Homer's creative use of the Greek language makes it far more interesting, his lengthy descriptions give the mind something to picture. Its as if you were there, standing next to each of the main warriors as these things happened to them. Homeric similes make the picture even more vivid, comparing the Greek and Trojan warriors to everything from deities to boars. Not only is this a tale of war, but the fights that occur between men when their pride gets hurt. How every man has that one thing he will always be mad about. The characters may seem devoid of human emotions, but eventually develop individual personalities. In only a few parts does it seem like only a listing, that the deaths that occur are not actually real people. You can relate to the main characters, sympathize or even hate them as you go through. The Greek gods are an extreme part of this tale. The war started because of gods, and they continued interfering all through the story. Even such things as sleep and ruin are characterized as being actual deities, showing us a side of Greek culture that not many knew of. An overlying theme in this book is based off of the Greek word aritei. This is the one thing every Greek warrior thrived for. It was honor. This honor could be found in battling a more experienced opponent than yourself, even if it did end in your death. Killing a man lower in rank, killing him after promising something to him, or defacing an enemy after his death could all result in the loss of aritei, immediately resulting in the lowering of one's honor. The Iliad is truly entertaining, whether you are reading it for the entertainment or historical value. So please, go, enjoy this amazing story of pride, honor, love, and war.--Submitted by Jessi Kluvich

Hi, can anyone help me to identify this translation of The Iliad (It has become something of an obsession for me now):    "Sing the wrath, O Goddess, the baleful wrath of Achilles son of Pelus, that laid on the Achaens ten thousand sorrows, and sent away goodly souls of heroes to Hades, and themselves it gave to dogs and all the birds; and the counsel of Zeus was fulfilled, from the day when first Atreides, king of men, and the divine Achilles quarrelled and stood apart. Who among the gods set them twain to fight?"    I've taken it from the first chapter of East and West by C. Northcote Parkinson, where the author describes it as "the opening lines of The Iliad".     In the bibliography at the end of the book, he has "Homer, The Iliad, translated by E.V.Rieu, Penguinn Classics, 1950.     So I got a copy of that exact book, but this it not it. This book begins "The Wrath of Achilles is my theme....". Really it's a much plainer version of that verse, without that kind of "old-world" sound to it (excuse my lame description of how the text sounds to me!)    I have googled some phrases from the quote, and the closest I've found is a version by Walter Leaf, Andrew Lang and Ernest Myers, 1873, but it is still significantly different.     I am beginning to think Parkinson made this up, i.e. paraphrased from several translations he had read, and then just looked up the most "current" translation for his bibliography, which would have been Rieu's. But there is something about the particular language that I really like, and I'd really like to find if it's an existing translation.     Any ideas? Thanks in advance!

-=-=-TEXT: In the tenth year of the Trojan War, tensions are running high among the Achaians (a super-ancient name for the Ancient Greeks). First, the priest Chryses comes to ask their leader, King Agamemnon, to release his daughter, whom Agamemnon was holding captive. When Agamemnon refuses, the priest prays to the god Apollo to send a plague against the Achaians.
After nine days of plague, the Achaians assemble again and demand that Agamemnon give the girl back. Agamemnon eventually agrees, but only if he gets to take Briseis, the girlfriend of Achilleus, the greatest warrior of the Achaians. Even though Achilleus gives her up, he becomes so enraged that he refuses to fight any more. That and he prays to his mother, Thetis, who happens to be a goddess, to pull some strings with the other gods so that the Achaians will start getting defeated in battle and realize how much they depend on him.
Achilleus's mom definitely spoils him. She gets Zeus, the king of the gods, to agree to Achilleus's request. Sure enough, the next day the Trojans make a successful counterattack, led by Hektor, their greatest warrior. Several days of violent fighting follow, at the end of which the Trojans have the Achaians pinned against the beach, and are threatening to burn their ships. At this point, Achilleus's best friend Patroklos asks for permission to go into battle in Achilleus's place. Achilleus grants Patroklos's request, and even lets him wear his armor. Patroklos's gambit is successful – when the Trojans see him, they think he must be Achilleus and become absolutely terrified. The plan goes off the rails, however, when Hektor kills Patroklos – with the help of the god Apollo and a minor Trojan warrior named Euphorbos. Hektor then takes the armor off Patroklos's body.
When Achilleus learns of the death of his friend, he experiences terrible grief and swears revenge. He sends his mother, Thetis, to get a new suit of armor made especially for him by the fire-god, Hephaistos. The next day, Achilleus rejoins the battle and kills many Trojans, including Hektor in a one-on-one battle. 
But Achilleus isn't satisfied. For the next few days, he continually abuses Hektor's body in gruesome ways, even after Patroklos has received a proper funeral. The gods don't like this, and send a message down to Achilleus telling him to give up the body. When the Trojan King Priam – Hektor's father – comes unarmed, by night, to ask for his son's body, Achilleus agrees. The two men eat together and experience a moment of shared humanity. Achilleus grants the Trojans a grace period to perform their funeral rituals. The poem ends with the funeral of Hektor – though we know that soon Achilleus will die and Troy will be captured.

-=-=-TEXT: Summary
Chryses, a priest of Apollo, journeys to the Achaian camp to request the return of his daughter Chryseis. Chryseis had been captured in a Greek siege and given to Agamemnon as a war prize. Chryses has brought many gifts as ransom for his daughter, but Agamemnon refuses to accept them and sends Chryses away. Apollo then revenges the ill treatment shown to his priest by sending a plague to the Greeks. The plague claims many lives, and a counsel is held to determine how to stop it. Through the advice of a seer, the Greeks agree that the return of Chryses is the only way to stop the plague from taking even more lives. Agamemnon, however, does not give up his prize willingly, and insists that he must have another man’s prize in exchange. He demands Briseis, the woman given to Achilleus in the same siege. Achilleus is so angry with Agamemnon for taking Briseis that he immediately withdraws himself and his troops from the fighting with Troy. He also asks his mother, the goddess Thetis, to plead with Zeus to help him avenge the wrong. Zeus agrees to assist the Trojans in their attack on the Achaians, thus showing Agamemnon that Achilleus is a great man, who would be necessary to succeed in battle.
Agamemnon gathers the rest of his army for a massive attack against the Trojans. The first day of battle opens with a duel between Paris and Menelaos, and a truce among the rest of the armies. After the duel, which ends with Paris being taken out of the battle by Aphrodite, the truce is broken by Pandaros, the Trojan, and the two armies engage in bitter fighting. At the end of the day, there is another duel, this time between Aias and Hektor, which is broken up before its end. The two sides retreat, and the Achaians build a wall around their encampment to protect their position and their ships.
When fighting resumes, Zeus pushes the Trojans to great triumph over the Achaians, and their victory seems certain. At this point, Agamemnon calls his leaders together and admits he was at fault in taking Briseis from Achilleus. He agrees to return her, along with a great deal of treasure and a sworn oath that he has not slept with her, if Achilleus will come back and fight with the Achaians. The message is brought to Achilleus by his good friends Odysseus, Aias, and Phoinix. Achilleus greets his friends warmly, but refuses to make peace with Agamemnon.
The next day the fighting resumes, and the Achaians fight well. However, over the span of the day, most of the best men are injured and taken out of the fight. These include Agamemnon, Diomedes, Odysseus, Eurypylos, and Machaon. The only remaining champion of the Achaians is Aias. Hektor then leads a strong drive by the Trojans, and they manage to break through the Achaian wall and fight all the way to the ships. As the Trojans attempt to set fire to the Achaian ships, the gods intervene and rescue the Achaians from almost certain destruction. At this point, Achilleus and his companion Patroklos become fearful for the fate of the Achaian army. While Achilleus still refuses to fight, he sends Patroklos out to the field in his own armor with a contingent of men to save the ships.
Because Patroklos and his army are rested and fresh, they easily drive the weary Trojans back to the city wall. Patroklos fights bravely and performs many courageous acts, but he pushes his luck and is eventually killed by Hektor. Hektor takes the famous armor of Achilleus from Patroklos, and a fierce battle is fought over his body. The Achaians manage to retrieve the body of Patroklos, but the battle has turned to the Trojan’s favor, and the Achaians retreat.
When Achilleus hears the news of his companion’s death, he is mad with rage against Hektor, but cannot rush into the battle without his armor. However, the gods transfigure him and when he shows himself on the battlefield the Trojans pull back and the Achaians escape. His mother Thetis acquires immortal armor from the god Hephaistos, and Achilleus announces to the assembled Achaians the end of his quarrel with Agamemnon. The next day the Achaians, mostly through the exploits of Achilleus, are able to drive the Trojans back inside their city walls. Hektor, however, refuses to go inside, promising to encounter Achilleus directly instead. His courage fails at the last minute and Achilleus pursues Hektor twice around the city walls. Hektor’s flight is finally halted through the trickery of Athene, and the two men duel. Hektor is killed and his body is dragged by the ankles behind Achilleus’ chariot back to the Achaian camp.
Achilleus then holds funeral games for Patroklos, giving many great prizes to the victors. Patroklos’ body is mourned and burned in a great pyre. In his grief over his friend, Achilleus has been dishonoring the body of Hektor, but the gods have kept it from mutilation. Priam is secretly guided by the gods to Achilleus to request his son’s body in exchange for a great ransom. Achilleus has pity on him, and returns the body. The Trojans then bury Hektor.
Estimated Reading Time
Allow an hour or slightly more to read each chapter, or book. There are a total of 24 books in the Iliad, totaling roughly 24-26 hours of reading time. Note: These eNotes are based on the 1951 Richmond Lattimore translation of the Iliad.
   Though the myths describe the Trojan War as a thirty-year cycle of preparations, conflict, and homecomings, the chronological period that the Iliad covers is actually quite restricted, not more than ninety days in the final year of fighting. Despite its focus on the quarrel of only two of its warriors, both of them Greek, Homer nevertheless conveys the full range of human emotions that prevails in war, even as he provides a vivid portrait of Mycenaean culture. The result is that his Iliad, bold and all-encompassing though it is, remains essentially quite limited; that is undoubtedly one of the most distinctive features of Homer’s epic. Homer makes the limits of his intentions clear from the outset. His invocation to Caliope, the Muse of epic, specifies that he will sing of Achilles’ anger. 
   Obviously, the anger of Achilles operates on several levels and has far-reaching consequences. On the personal level, it refers to the quarrel between Achilles and Agamemnon for possession of Briseis, a young woman originally given to Achilles by the Achaeans as his prize of honor. Agamemnon, too, had a captive mistress, Chryseis; yet, she was the daughter of a priest of Apollo named Chryses. When Agamemnon haughtily refuses to return Chryseis to her father, Chryses invokes Apollo himself, who sends a plague upon the Achaeans. Once he realizes that the army will be decimated by disease if he takes no action, Agamemnon returns Chryseis to her father, though he simultaneously demands that Achilles surrender Briseis to him as her replacement. Agamemnon fears that the Achaeans will consider him weak if he does not enforce his will upon Achilles in this way, yet the reader perceives only Agamemnon’s pettiness and insecurity. 
   Achilles reviles Agamemnon in the agora (assembly) of leaders, yet he surrenders Briseis to him without active resistance. More significantly, Achilles announces his intentions to withdraw his Myrmidons from battle and return with them to Phthia, their home in southern Thessaly. These dramatic announcements made, Achilles throws down the skeptron (staff), which gives him the uncontested right to speak, and dashes from the agora. This extraordinary behavior at the least implies weakness and apparently cowardice. It seems to complement the pettiness of Agamemnon, but there are clearly other reasons for Achilles’ actions. 
   Thetis, the goddess-mother of Achilles, subsequently appears to comfort her son, who is all too aware of how the Achaeans could interpret his sudden withdrawal and threat to return home. She reviews the alternatives that moira (fate) has assigned to him: either to slay Hector, the first of the Trojan warriors, and to be killed at Troy soon thereafter or to live a long and undistinguished life in Phthia, dying there of old age. Achilles well knows these alternatives. His withdrawal, which extends from Iliad 1 to Iliad 22, represents an essential pause to consider these alternatives at a crucial juncture of his life. Worth noting is the fact that Achilles undertakes no preparations to return home; also, although the war initially goes badly for the Achaeans, to the extent that Agamemnon offers Achilles an impressive series of gifts (including restoration of Briseis) for his return, Achilles’ prolonged absence makes relatively little difference overall. 
   Agamemnon’s embassy to secure Achilles’ return contains elements of magnanimity and self-interest. Significantly, Agamemnon does not personally entreat Achilles. Instead, he enlists the cunning Odysseus and Diomedes (who would together devise the stratagem of the wooden horse), as well as Achilles’ old tutor Phoenix. The appeal thus emerges through a combination of clever argument and sage advice, and the collection of gifts (listed in catalog form) is calculated both to impress the Achaeans with Agamemnon’s megalapsyché (great-heartedness, generosity), as much as it is to force Achilles to make his decision. That is one of several places in which the humanity of the poem emerges. Achilles’ concern for his old tutor, seen in his insistence that Phoenix remain overnight rather than attempt to return immediately, shows that he values privileged relationships such as master and student. It has its counterpart in Achilles’ relationship to Patroclus, his young protégé in the art of war. This relationship, severed by Patroclus’s death, will ultimately provide the impetus that Achilles needs to accept the short but glorious life that moira has offered him. 
   In one sense, all the characters of the Iliad recognize the inevitability of moira yet remain essentially powerless to change it. The tears of Achilles that precede his mother’s appearance are an indication of this human frailty, but so is Hector’s meeting with his wife, Andromache, and their infant son, Astyanax. In Iliad 6, long before Achilles returns to battle, the Achaeans have advanced to the very walls of Troy. Hector, the bravest of the Trojan warriors, searches for Alexandrus (Paris), whose theft of Helen had been the immediate cause of the war, and finds him in Helen’s rooms. His reproaches make Alexandrus recognize his obligations, and Alexandrus takes up his arms to defend the city, but the primary contrast is clear. Andromache recognizes and regretfully accepts the likelihood of her husband’s death in battle, but Helen belittles Alexandrus as a sensualist willing to allow others to fight for him. Andromache’s fears for Hector correspond to those of the child, Astyanax, who does not recognize his father because of the helmet that he wears. When Hector removes the helmet, the child accepts his father’s embrace, and the couple laughs. There, then, is a contrast between pure love and simple sensual attraction as well as between responsibility and weakness. 
   Even the deities of Olympus display the flaws of their human counterparts. They, too, remain tied to moira and are essentially powerless to change it. They, too, govern by agorai, and these assemblies inevitably end as inconclusively as those of the human warriors below. The gods and goddesses have taken sides in the war, but these reflect their previous personal antagonisms rather than their concern with humanity. Thetis, for example, does intercede with Zeus for her son Achilles but is aware that doing so will necessarily provoke the jealousy of Hera, Zeus’s wife. She must also know that any favor that Zeus grants to Achilles would necessarily be in the context of glory on the battlefield. Ironically, any such benefaction would necessarily hasten her son’s death. Just as Agamemnon prevails in the human order, so does Zeus in the divine; yet neither appears able to take meaningful and decisive actions that affect outcomes. The power of both is limited to immediate actions and short-term results. 
   The peculiar powerlessness of Zeus emerges clearly in the Sarpedon episode, Iliad 16. At this point, Patroclus has received Achilles’ permission to reenter battle wearing his master’s armor. Patroclus experiences his aristeia (moment of glory), a series of combats in which he defeats one opponent after another. Sarpedon, a beautiful boy loved by Zeus, is one of those whom moira has determined that Patroclus will defeat. Zeus raises the scales of moira, watches Sarpedon’s weight descend, and realizes that he must accept the young man’s death. His resignation to moira parallels that of Andromache, even as it underscores the similarity of mortals and immortals. 
   Though Achilles allows his protégé, Patroclus, to enter battle, he himself remains apart. Patroclus is effectively Achilles’ surrogate, however, and his appearance in his master’s armor emphasizes this relationship. So devastating is the effect of his presence that the Trojans at first believe Achilles has returned. In one sense that is true, for Patroclus looks very much like Achilles, and the aristeia that he enjoys is equivalent to any that his master could have enjoyed. It is also true that once Patroclus has entered battle, the moira of Achilles is sealed, for the lives of master and student are tied by the bonds of friendship and obligation. Patroclus dies at the hands of Hector, and while Hector succeeds in claiming the armor of Achilles, the body of Patroclus remains with the Greeks. The announcement of Patroclus’s death sends Achilles into a threnody and leads to his construction of an extravagant pyre for the corpse. This development provides the opportunity for another catalog listing the offerings that formed the pyre. Averse as human sacrifice was to Greek sensibilities, the pyre includes young Trojans captured in battle. 
   Achilles now recognizes that his obligations to Patroclus have forced his return, but he has no armor worthy of the event. Thetis intervenes again, this time to secure armor crafted by the artisan deity Hephaestus, and once again Thetis’s intervention hastens her son’s moira. In effect, the alternatives that had existed in Iliad 1 are no longer available. The period of intros2pection has ended, and Achilles reenters battle knowing that he will kill Hector but equally aware that his own death will follow soon after. When Achilles meets Hector in battle, he is, in effect, encountering an aspect of himself. Hector wears the armor of Achilles, and Achilles has donned the glorious new armor that his mother, Thetis, had secured for him. In killing Hector, especially because Homer has already portrayed that warrior’s character so sympathetically, Achilles eliminates his ties to the past and fully accepts the alternative of a short but glorious life. It is his true destiny and, like the armor provided by Thetis, the only moira that is appropriate for him. 
   The humanity that lies behind so much of the bravado in the Iliad emerges in the final scene of the poem. Old Priam, king of Troy, comes to Achilles to beg for the return of his son’s body. Even though Achilles realizes that Hector had been the immediate cause of his beloved Patroclus’s death and that Hector had forced Achilles to accept his own moira, he grants Priam’s request and declares a truce for ritual mourning and appropriate burial of the dead on both sides. The Iliad thus ends in a suspension, rather than a resolution, of events.

-=-=-SNIPPET:  re not gonna lie, after watching the cringe-worthy u201cIliadu201d scene from J.Lo
-=-=-TEXT: We’re not gonna lie, after watching the cringe-worthy “Iliad” scene from J.Lo’s new movie “The Boy Next Door” we wept for humanity a bit. Then, like the rest of the world we wondered “How the heck did this happen? Is Hollywood really that stupid?”
In case you missed it, the awful scene shows J.Lo’s hunky love interest / psychotic neighbor giving her a “first edition” copy of Homer’s The Iliad. You know, that epic 3,000-year-old-ish poem he wrote. The one in which the oldest version, called the Venetus A, dates back to the 10th century? Yeah. The “first edition” seen in the movie is clearly not 3,000 years old.
We just couldn’t let it go (seriously, The Iliad? Pick ANY other book), so we contacted the screenwriter, Barbara Curry, a former Assistant U.S. Attorney, and asked her point blank: “WTF happened?”
Turns out writers aren’t that dumb. But Hollywood producers are.
“Much of my original script was rewritten by the producers and the director.  I was not given the opportunity to participate in the production of this movie,” Curry told Fusion. “As for the first edition ‘Iliad’ reference in the movie, that was not something I wrote in my original script,” she says.
However, Curry says she’s not trying to disparage the film or the many talented people who worked on it. “My only point is that I had a different vision as reflected in my script. Of course, I am disappointed that my vision and my script weren’t followed. But we all have different opinions about music, art, film.”
That said, it’s no secret Hollywood likes to rewrite scripts over and over again (Too many cooks!) — and in this case, it bit them in the ass. Curry, who holds a JD from Northwestern, added, “I am not sure why they felt a need to change my script so very much.  My original script had won numerous awards … I was told by the producer who actually purchased the script that he loved it and didn’t want me to change a word.  Someone else obviously disagreed.”
Someone who’s never read the classics, apparently.

-=-=-TEXT:      Iliad Homer   
     Circa eighth century b.c. Greek poem.   
     The following entry contains criticism on Homer's Iliad from 1983 to 2000. See also Homer Poetry Criticism.   
     A seminal epic widely accepted as one of the greatest literary artifacts of Western civilization, the Iliad has been admired for centuries for its artistry as well as for the profound influence it has exerted on European literature. Within its epic scope, set in the tenth year of a legendary war between Greeks and Trojans at Ilios (Troy), the Iliad depicts the heroic ethos of a mythic era personified in the figure of Achilles, a Greek hero of unrivaled martial excellence, who chooses undying fame won on the battlefield over the prospect of a long life. The epic's proper subject is the wrath of Achilles and its tragic consequences, but it also explores such themes as the workings of fate, honor, and the human urge toward immortality. Likewise, the Iliad delineates the heroic code—the thematic basis of all subsequent epic poetry. While theories regarding its author, the near-mythic Homer, continue to spur scholarly debate, the poem itself is renowned for its compelling narrative, vivid imagery, poetic technique, psychological scope, and stylistic clarity.   
     Biographical Information   
     Almost nothing is known about Homer, but scholars hypothesize that he was an Ionian Greek (probably from the coast of Asia Minor or one of the adjacent islands), that he was born sometime before 700 b.c., and that he lived in approximately the latter half of the eighth century b.c. According to legend, he was a blind itinerant poet (the Greek word homēros means blind man); historians note that singing bards in ancient Greece were often blind and that the legend, therefore, may be based on fact, but that it is also possible that Homer may have lost his sight only late in life, or that his purported blindness was meant to mask his illiteracy. Internal evidence from the two major works attributed to Homer suggests that the Iliad preceded the Odyssey and that both were composed in the eighth century b.c. in a dialect that was a mixture of Ionic and Aeolic Greek.   
     Biographies of Homer exist in the form of six early “lives” and assorted commentaries by ancient and Byzantine scholars, but the information they contain is considered unreliable and mostly mythical. Some commentators have even gone so far as to assert that no such individual as Homer ever lived. Due to the paucity of information regarding Homer, the manner of the composition of the Iliad has been one of determined critical speculation that has brought together the efforts of experts in such fields as archaeology, linguistics, and comparative literature. In the 1920s the critic Milman Parry proposed that both the Iliad and the Odyssey were composed orally. Parry established that Homeric verse is formulaic by nature, relying on generic epithets (such as “wine-dark sea” and “rosy-fingered dawn”), repetition of stock lines and half-lines, and scenes and themes typical of traditional folk poetry. Comparing Homer's poetry with ancient oral epics from other cultures, Parry deduced that Homer was most likely a rhapsode, or itinerant professional reciter, who improvised stories to be sung at Greek festivals. As a public performer, Homer probably learned to weave together standard epic story threads and descriptions in order to sustain his narrative, relying on mnemonic devices and phrases to fill the natural metrical units of poetic lines. Parry's theory stressed the derivative, evolutionary character of Homer's poetry but affirmed his individual genius as a shaper of traditional elements whose creations far exceeded the sum of their borrowed parts. Many contemporary critics accept Parry's analysis of the authorship question, although critical speculation about the subject continues.   
     Textual History   
     Scholarly consensus regarding the composition of the Iliad holds that the poem was most probably transmitted orally by local bards and first written down on papyri shortly after Homer's death. Although Homeric Greece did not yet have a system of writing appropriate for literary texts, records indicate that a Phoenician alphabet may have been adapted and used to record the poem in the eighth century b.c. Once set down in writing, the poem most likely became the exclusive property of the Homeridae, or sons of Homer, a bardic guild whose members performed and preserved the poem. Scholars conclude that in the second half of the sixth century b.c. the Athenian dictator Peisistratus, who ruled from 560 to 527 b.c., established a Commission of Editors of Homer to edit the text of the poems and remove any errors and interpolations that had accumulated in the process of transmission—thereby establishing a canon of Homer. The origin of the poem's current title, which means “the poem of Ilios” (the Homeric name for Troy), remains a matter of conjecture. Scholars are uncertain whether Homer ever used it, for the earliest mention of the title discovered was by Herodotus in the fifth century b.c. Fragments of papyri, a third-century codex, and two other partial manuscripts exist, but the oldest full surviving manuscript of the poem, probably transcribed by a Byzantine scholar, dates from the ninth century. The first printed edition of Homer's poetry appeared in Europe in 1488 and remained in use until the seventeenth century. Many translations, both prose and verse, of the Iliad have subsequently been published. Critics agree that the most influential of these have been by George Chapman, Alexander Pope, and the translation team consisting of Andrew Lang, Walter Leaf, and Ernest Myers; in the contemporary period the edition most highly regarded and frequently used is that of Richmond Lattimore.   
     Plot and Major Characters   
     Approximately 15,000 lines long and divided into twenty-four books (a structure that seems to date from the third century b.c. rather than from Homer's lifetime), the Iliad is composed in dactylic, or “heroic,” hexameter. The action of the poem occurs near the Hellespont, in northwest Asia Minor, during the Trojan War, which archaeologists estimate took place in the second half of the twelfth century b.c. The plot begins in medias res, recounting an episode near the end of the war between the besieged Trojans, under King Priam, and the attacking Greeks (or Achaeans as they are generally named in the poem), led by King Agamemnon of Mycenae and his brother Menelaus of Sparta. One of Priam's sons, the self-indulgent Paris, has abducted the fabled beauty, Helen, wife of Menelaus. After a massive naval assault, fighting has dragged on for nearly ten years. During that time the Greek armies, including the mighty Myrmidons commanded by Achilles, the bravest and most headstrong of Agamemnon's supporters, have managed to capture and loot a portion of Trojan territory, but have failed to breach the massive walls of Troy. Incidents in the first book of the epic draw Achilles and Agamemnon into a disastrous quarrel. Through his refusal to return Chryseis, a captured Trojan girl and the daughter of a priest of Apollo, Agamemnon invites a divine plague on the Greek army. In order to assuage Apollo's wrath and end the plague, Agamemnon later agrees to part with Chryseis, but demands Briseis, a Trojan concubine to Achilles, as compensation. In response to this dishonor, Achilles withdraws his troops in indignation, refusing to aid Agamemnon any further. Achilles prays that the Achaeans be defeated on the battlefield in his absence, a message his immortal mother, Thetis, conveys to Zeus, the ruler of the gods. Meanwhile, Agamemnon receives an enigmatic dream from the all-mighty Zeus, telling him he will soon defeat Troy. Armed with this knowledge, the Greek leader decides to test the resolve of his Achaean warriors. In a ruse to boost morale, Agamemnon proposes that his soldiers return to Greece, but his rhetorical trick backfires, leaving the quick-witted Ithacan king Odysseus to convince them to stay and fight. An unsuccessful truce between the Greeks and the Trojans follows, intended to provide the opportunity for Menelaus and Paris to settle their feud by single combat. The duel proves indecisive as Paris is whisked from the battlefield by the goddess Aphrodite before he can be defeated. When fighting resumes, the Greek hero Diomedes, under the divine protection of Athena, takes to the field. He attacks and wounds two immortals, Aphrodite and the war god Ares, both of whom fight for Troy. Thereafter, Zeus decides to set his plan for a reversal of Greek fortunes into motion. The Trojans swiftly gain the upper hand in combat, despite a successful night raid by Odysseus and Diomedes on their camp. The following morning the Trojans take the offensive. Led by Hector, another of Priam's sons and the finest of the Trojan warriors, they penetrate the Greek defenses. Only temporarily slowed by the formidable Achaean hero Ajax the Greater, Hector sets fire to one of the Greek ships. At this point, Achilles relents and sends the Myrmidons, commanded by his beloved friend Patroclus, to assist Agamemnon in defense of the ships. An outstanding warrior, Patroclus performs gloriously in battle while clad in Achilles's nearly-impenetrable armor. He slays a host of Trojans, including the hero Sarpedon, before being killed himself by Hector below the walls of Troy. In sorrow and rage, Achilles determines to rejoin the battle and obtain revenge on Hector. But first, his mother, Thetis, visits Hephaestus, blacksmith to the gods, and asks that he forge a new set of armor for Achilles. Hephaestus fulfills the request, creating an outstanding shield that symbolically depicts a city at peace and a city besieged in war. On the field of battle, Achilles's rage is unstoppable. He single-handedly repels the Trojan forces and kills Hector, dishonoring the noble warrior by mutilating his corpse by tying it to a chariot and dragging it around the city. King Priam, overtaken by grief for his son, visits Achilles in his camp and begs for the return of Hector's body so that the proper funeral rites can be performed. Moved by his passionate supplication, Achilles agrees and the work closes with a description of Hector's funeral.   
     Major Themes   
     As the principal focus of the Iliad, Achilles embodies many of the major themes in the work. Among these is his choice to intensely pursue timē (roughly meaning “honor” or “prestige”), kleos (“glory”), and aretē (“martial virtue”) in order to secure his immortality as a great warrior, even if it means his early death. Thus, Achilles personifies the dual Greek conception of the brevity of life and the eternity of fame. Through Achilles, Homer delineates the heroic code fundamental to Western literature: that the chief aim of a hero's life is to win renown for his aristeia (which denotes “excellence,” “courage,” and “prowess”) using all the resources given to him through his aristocratic birth, wealth, intelligence, and military and athletic abilities. Furthermore, he fiercely guards his honor and that of his companions, strives to fulfill his aidōs (“duty” or obligation to community), and accepts his moira (“fate”) despite his constant striving for success. That Achilles rejects his aidōs for the vast majority of the epic, instead showing himself to be vain, intemperate, and boastful while he stands aside from the battling Greeks, suggests Homer's balancing of noble, heroic behavior with human flaws and limitations. Only in the final book of the Iliad, with King Priam begging for his fallen son's corpse, does Achilles acknowledge his communal responsibilities, treating the defeated King with pity rather than wrath. To a degree, Homer also humanizes the divine figures in the epic, the pantheon of Olympian gods including Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Athena, and Apollo. Rather than depicting the immortals as paragons of virtue or restraint, Homer characterizes these figures, for all of their knowledge and power, as variously jealous, deceitful, manipulative, capricious, wrathful, or petty. Homer conveys an additional theme of great significance to the Iliad largely through the work's renowned similes, a number of which describe scenes of ordinary, peaceful life juxtaposed against the violent and bloody warfare that drives the narrative. Likewise, Homer highlights the stark contrast between peace and conflict in the scenes painted on Achilles's shield—a device singled out by many critics as the symbolic touchstone of the epic.   
     Critical Reception   
     As one of the best known literary works of the Western world, the Iliad has inspired much critical commentary and has wielded an enormous influence on later authors and readers. Over the centuries, critics have been nearly unanimous in praising Homer's handling of the narrative, imagery, structure, and themes of the Iliad. They commend his ability to intersperse lengthy descriptions of battle scenes with highly dramatic dialogue, whimsical fantasy about the gods of Olympus, and, at certain key moments, moving lyrical poetry. Homer's genius, scholars have asserted, is most evident in his masterful yet self-effacing storytelling technique. In a perfectly plain and direct manner, the narrator carries the action forward, examining the events in great detail and occasionally digressing from the main narrative, but always in such a manner that the course of the tale seems natural and entirely inevitable. In addition to praising Homer's seamless narrative technique, with its flawless manipulation of tightly woven incident, simple design, and panoramic scope, scholars have acknowledged the immediacy and crystalline clarity of the Iliad's imagery. Special consideration has been reserved for Homer's extended similes, said to enhance the realism and enlarge the range of the poem by bringing into its military world parallel images from domestic life, agriculture, and nature. Critics have also marveled at the degree of accuracy demonstrated by Homer in his portrayal of battle scenes; his knowledge of weapons, battle strategy, and even the medical treatment of wounds has proved uncannily thorough.   
     Although most commentators praise the narrative impact and brilliant imagery of the Iliad, there remains a great deal of debate regarding the structural and thematic unity of the poem. A number of contemporary scholars have examined the underlying complexities of work's narrative structure and thematic framework, highlighting Homer's use of misdirection, parallelism, and reversal. Some interpreters have suggested that Homer's portrayal of the Trojans is not adequately balanced with that of the Greeks, citing evidence that the poem is biased toward Achaean heroes, and finally withholds the glory due to the Trojans. Overall, however, critics have tended to cite the comprehensive and cohesive vision of life depicted in the Iliad as the poem's central unifying principle. Although Homer presents an extremely harsh world in which human beings appear destined to suffer as the mere playthings of the gods and fate, he simultaneously conveys the value of human ideals and the joy of pursuing heroic excellence. Late twentieth-century critics have continued to focus on such specialized topics as Homer's narrative technique, use of irony and humor, and development of individual characters, considering the poet's treatment of the gods in relation to mortals, or probing such minor themes as the guilt of Helen or Paris.   
     Exploring Homer's philosophical beliefs, scholars still grapple with his presentation of death, divine and human justice, and the role of the citizen and the state in society. The concepts of aidōs, aristeia, and other elements of the heroic code have also inspired considerable commentary. Homer's rich use of simile continues to elicit interest, with scholars considering his descriptions of heroes as wild beasts, as well as his lyric evocation of human gentleness, care, and nurturing in the brutal context of war. With the ongoing proliferation of critical attention to the Iliad, the oldest and in some ways the most formidable work of Western literature has remained fresh and intriguing for generation after generation of scholars and readers. It impresses as much by its thematic complexity as by its stylistic simplicity, as much by its depiction of tragedy as by its celebration of life, and as much by its harsh descriptions of warfare as by its tender lyric poetry.

THE EMBASSY
The encounter of Achilles and Hektor depends upon the withdrawal of the former, which tempts Hektor beyond the safety of the walls. The withdrawal is the beginning of the plot, the duel its end. The protagonist is absent in the middle. That absence is a narrative fact of great and continuing significance. But its representation is a...

[In the following essay, originally published in Italian in 1985, Pucci elucidates Athena's appearance to Achilles at Iliad 1.194ff, examining the manner in which Homer presents the revelation of gods to mortals in the epic.]
In Homeric narrative a god appears to a hero and, by virtue of his presence, determines or intensifies to the highest degree the action that the hero performs. Regardless of whether the god suggests a plan of action (Iliad 2.165ff., etc.), prevents the hero...

[In the following essay, Knox studies the thematic course of the Iliad embodied by Achilles, observing that the hero traces a path from “godlike self-absorption” driven by honor and rage to his recognition of pity and the values of human community.]
There are in the Iliad two human beings who are godlike, Achilles and Helen. One of them has already come to a bitter recognition of human stature and moral responsibility when the poem begins. Helen, the cause of the war, is so preeminent in her sphere, so far beyond competition in her beauty, her power to enchant men,...

[In the following essay, Traill contends that Homer does not allow the Trojan hero Hector the full glory he deserves in the Iliad, and instead presents him in a less favorable manner than lesser Greek figures.]
It is one of the puzzling features of the Iliad that while Homer undoubtedly depicts Trojan heroes, notably Hector and Priam, in a favorable light in domestic scenes, Trojans in general, and Hector in particular, are not allowed to shine on the battlefield with the luster one expects. Thus, though most modern readers readily admire Priam for the...

In a key passage in Book 1 of the Iliad Achilles, in order to obtain from Zeus the favor that will determine the trajectory of the plot, invokes not Athena or Hera, those powerful, inveterate pro-Greeks, but his mother. The Iliad's presentation of Thetis … is of a subsidiary deity who is...

This [essay] examines thematic misdirection, which is brought about by false authoritative predictions.

In the central books of Homer's Iliad, the Greeks come under Trojan attack. In Book 12 the Greek camp is assaulted; in Books 15 and 16 Hector threatens to burn the Greek fleet. With its walls and defenses, the Greek camp is in many ways like a city (polis), as previous commentators have...

No act of supplication in the Iliad is so elaborately prepared as Priam's supplication of Achilles in the final book.

Characterization in Homer is a controversial subject.

-=-=-TITLE: Deutsche Telekom’s Earnings Beat Expections - NYTimes.com
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT:  LONDON — Deutsche Telekom of Germany, Europe’s largest carrier by revenue, on Wednesday reported an 11 percent increase in its pretax profit, as a weak euro and the company’s United States operations bolstered its first-quarter earnings.
The German telecommunication giant, which owns 66 percent of T-Mobile US, said its adjusted pretax profit in the first three months of 2015 rose to €4.6 billion, or about $5.17 billion, slightly ahead of the €4.4 billion forecast from analysts polled by Reuters.
The carrier’s quarterly revenue jumped 13 percent, to €16.8 billion, as Deutsche Telekom’s push to add customers to its United States operations continued to gather speed.
After rebuffing attempts by the French telecommunications company Iliad to acquire T-Mobile last year, Deutsche Telekom has been aggressively expanding across the United States, using price cuts and other offers to entice consumers away from larger carriers like AT&T and Verizon Wireless.
T-Mobile added roughly two million new subscribers in the first quarter of the year, Deutsche Telekom said, and now has almost 57 million cellphone customers across the United States.
“It has been some time since we have seen positive indications for revenue and earnings in our industry,” Timotheus Höttges, Deutsche Telekom’s chief executive, said in a news release . “Our clear strategy with strong investment is paying off.”
As Europe’s telecom sector undergoes a new round of consolidation, Deutsche Telekom has been at the center of a number of deals since the beginning of the year.
In February, for example, the German carrier and Orange, its French rival, agreed to sell their British joint venture to the local telecommunications company BT for $19 billion.
Deutsche Telekom’s net income for the first three months of the year totaled €787 million. That represents a 57 percent decline over the same period last year, when the company benefited from the €1.5 billion sale of its majority stake in the online classified advertising company Scout24 to the private equity firm Hellman & Friedman.
In its domestic market, the carrier said the number of its mobile subscribers rose slightly, to 39.2 million customers. The company also added almost half a million new high-speed German broadband subscribers in the first quarter of the year as people upgraded their Internet packages to stream video and other online content to their homes.

-=-=-TEXT: The poems of Illiad depict the seige of the city of Ilion or Troy during the Trojan War. The word Illiad itself means "something concerned with Ilion". Illion was the city based in the state of Troy. When Illiad was created, is arguable. Some scholars are adamant that it was written around the 8th - 9th century, while some debate it must have been written during the 6th - 7th century.
The whole Illiad is devoted to war of Troy, giving a detailed poetic description of the war. The characters of the fighters, their battle cries and all the intricate details of the war are mentioned. The epic has strong religious and supernatural influence. Both warring parties are extremely religious and the Greek and Trojan heroes draw strength from favored gods, giving them divine power. Regularly making sacrifices to Gods, while the Gods constantly intervene in the war on behalf of their believers, almost treating the humans as puppets for their own causes.
 The Illiad covers only the final and tenth year of the Trojan war. The intial war years, the background of the war and the end of the war are given a miss.

-=-=-TITLE: Combat trauma expert visiting Maine details ‘moral injuries’ of war — Health — Bangor Daily News — BDN Maine
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: Tweet Troy R. Bennett | BDN Dr. Jonathan Shay, a psychologist and author of two books on combat trauma and the trials of homecoming for veterans and their families. Follow on Twitter Posted May 13, 2015, at 5:27 a.m. 
PORTLAND, Maine — Post-traumatic stress disorder has become so familiar among the many difficulties veterans face after returning from war that most know it by its acronym — PTSD. 
But the diagnosis reflects only part of the broader psychological harm soldiers bring home from the battlefield, according to Dr. Jonathan Shay, a nationally recognized psychologist and author of two books on combat trauma and the trials of homecoming for veterans and their families. 
Shay’s visiting Maine this week to meet with veterans groups and their supporters, and he will give two public addresses on Wednesday at the University of Maine . He spoke to members of the Maine State Bar Association and the Maine Judiciary in Portland on Tuesday. 
Shay views the experiences of combat veterans from perspectives found in two great works of literature, Homer’s “Iliad” and “Odyssey.” A recipient of a MacArthur Foundation “Genius Grant,” he wrote “Achilles in Vietnam: Combat Trauma and the Undoing of Character” in 1994, followed by “Odysseus in America: Combat Trauma and the Trials of Homecoming” in 2002. 
Shay coined a new term — “moral injury”— to capture what a PTSD diagnosis leaves out. Some hope that it, too, will join the common lexicon. 
The hallmark symptoms of PTSD — nightmares and flashbacks, withdrawal from society and interests, hyper-arousal to anticipated dangers — are useful from an evolutionary perspective but destructive in civilian life, he said. 
“PTSD, as defined by the American Psychiatric Association, is not a bad summary of what it looks like when other human beings have been trying to kill you and doing a damn good job of it,” he said in an interview. 
Beyond the immediacy of mortal danger, however, service members face psychological wounds when the realities of war conflict with a communal sense of right and wrong, Shay said. Unable to reconcile the two, many descend into a “terrible state of being” upon returning home, he said. 
Moral injury, as Shay defines it, results when a leader who holds legitimate authority betrays what’s commonly accepted as right, in a high-stakes situation. 
Imagine an infantry squad surrounded by the enemy, he said, tormented by a sergeant’s order to retreat while a fellow soldier lays wounded and screaming. For service members instilled with the concept of “leave no man behind,” that presents a moral crisis, he said. 
It also reflects another form of moral injury, advanced by other researchers in the field, in which soldiers betray their own sense of morality, Shay said. Obeying the order and abandoning a comrade could leave a solider with crippling guilt and shame. 
Even witnessing or learning of such an event can prove harmful, he said. 
While moral injury isn’t a formal diagnosis, like PTSD, sufferers physically reel from the pain of a crumbling moral foundation, Shay said. 
“The body reacts massively,” he said. “The body codes moral injury as physical attack.” 
The damage to the mind and spirit can persist for years, fueling deep mistrust that dismantles veterans’ social relationships, Shay said. 
“It just devastates the capacity to have a good human life,” he said. “When trust is destroyed, it doesn’t leave a vacuum, it doesn’t leave nothing. When trust is destroyed, it leaves behind the active expectancy of harm, exploitation and humiliation.” 
Some sufferers choose to strike first. During his 20 years as a staff psychiatrist in the Department of Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic in Boston, sometimes “a veteran I had never previously met comes through my door on the attack before he’s even set foot in my office,” Shay said. 
Others cut off contact, living in isolation, or hide behind manufactured identities and lies, he said. 
Anyone who works with veterans, from employers to government agencies, would be well-served to keep these struggles in mind, he said. 
In Maine, about one in 10 residents is a veteran , giving the state one of the highest populations of veterans per capita in the nation. Nearly three-quarters of them served during wartime. 
Organizers of Shay’s visit to Maine hope to raise awareness about combat veterans’ experiences, train health providers to better serve them, foster ethical leaders, and forge new ways to deal with PTSD and other combat-related injuries. 
Shay’s visit to Maine is sponsored by the Maine Military & Community Network, Maine Infantry Foundation, Acadia Hospital, the University of Maine Humanities Center, the Bangor Daily News, and the law firms of Verrill & Dana in Portland and Vafiades, Brountas & Kominsky in Bangor.

During the S.H.I.E.L.D. Civil War, S.H.I.E.L.D. suffered heavy casualties at the hands of HYDRA, losing many bases and most of its equipment to the reborn terrorist organization. HYDRA's moles on the Iliad attempted to take possession of the ship, but the loyal S.H.I.E.L.D. agents managed to defeat them all. During the battle, Agent Robert Gonzales was almost killed but he was saved by Agent Isabelle Hartley.

Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics:
 All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences—biographical, historical, and literary—to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. 
The epic song of Ilion (an old name for Troy), The Iliad recreates a few dramatic weeks near the end of the fabled Trojan War, ending with the funeral of Hector, defender of the doomed city. Through its majestic verses stride the fabled heroes Priam, Hector, Paris, and Aeneas for Troy; Achilles, Ajax, Menelaus, Agamemnon, Patroclus, and Odysseus for the Greeks; and the beautiful Helen, over whom the longstanding war has been waged. Never far from the center of the story are the quarreling gods: Zeus, Poseidon, Apollo, Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite.
The Iliad is the oldest Greek poem and perhaps the best-known epic in Western literature, and has inspired countless works of art throughout its long history. An assemblage of stories and legends shaped into a compelling single narrative, The Iliad was probably recited orally by bards for generations before being written down in the eighth century B.C. A beloved fixture of early Greek culture, the poem found eager new audiences when it was translated into many languages during the Renaissance. Its themes of honor, power, status, heroism, and the whims of the gods have ensured its enduring popularity and immeasurable cultural influence.

                                 We know very little about the author of The Odyssey and its companion tale, The Iliad. Most scholars agree that Homer was Greek; those who try to identify his origin on the basis of dialect forms in the poems tend to choose as his homeland either Smyrna, now the Turkish city known as Izmir, or Chios, an island in the eastern Aegean Sea. 
    According to legend, Homer was blind, though scholarly evidence can neither confirm nor contradict the point. 
    The ongoing debate about who Homer was, when he lived, and even if he wrote The Odyssey and The Iliad is known as the "Homeric question." Classicists do agree that these tales of the fall of the city of Troy (Ilium) in the Trojan War (The Iliad) and the aftermath of that ten-year battle (The Odyssey) coincide with the ending of the Mycenaean period around 1200 BCE (a date that corresponds with the end of the Bronze Age throughout the Eastern Mediterranean). The Mycenaeans were a society of warriors and traders; beginning around 1600 BCE, they became a major power in the Mediterranean. Brilliant potters and architects, they also developed a system of writing known as Linear B, based on a syllabary, writing in which each symbol stands for a syllable.  
         Scholars disagree on when Homer lived or when he might have written The Odyssey. Some have placed Homer in the late-Mycenaean period, which means he would have written about the Trojan War as recent history. Close study of the texts, however, reveals aspects of political, material, religious, and military life of the Bronze Age and of the so-called Dark Age, as the period of domination by the less-advanced Dorian invaders who usurped the Mycenaeans is known. But how, other scholars argue, could Homer have created works of such magnitude in the Dark Age, when there was no system of writing? Herodotus, the ancient Greek historian, placed Homer sometime around the ninth century BCE, at the beginning of the Archaic period, in which the Greeks adopted a system of writing from the Phoenicians and widely colonized the Mediterranean. And modern scholarship shows that the most recent details in the poems are datable to the period between 750 and 700 BCE.  
  No one, however, disputes the fact that The Odyssey (and The Iliad as well) arose from oral tradition. Stock phrases, types of episodes, and repeated phrases -- such as "early, rose-fingered dawn" -- bear the mark of epic storytelling. Scholars agree, too, that this tale of the Greek hero Odysseus's journey and adventures as he returned home from Troy to Ithaca is a work of the greatest historical significance and, indeed, one of the foundations of Western literature.

                                The meter (rhythmic pattern of syllables) of Homer's epic poems is dactylic hexameter. 
From Bruce M. King’s Introduction to The Iliad
The Iliad, then, even as it sings the immortality of its heroes, suggests an end to their imagined era and to the political order that is located there. Indeed, one of the great feats of the Iliad is to pose a critique—centered upon the withdrawals and speeches of Achilles—of the heroic order and the possibilities that it offers for mortal happiness. From this point of view, the essential work of the Iliad is one of negation—again, the epic is unjust with respect to the old, but potentially beneficent with respect to the future. The old heroic order—for all its blinding beauties and exaltations, for all its aspirant motion toward the realm of the aesthetic—is also revealed as unable to quell strife and its attendant violence, as conducive to no just stability and, finally, as a desolation to its own greatest heroes (as the complaints and career of Achilles will dramatize). To the extent that it thematizes the obsolescence of the old heroic order, the Iliad reveals an orientation toward the future; the poem cannot invent the forms that will govern the future, but it can present to the future a kind of tabula rasa, upon which the poet’s audience might reinscribe new meanings out of the wreckage of the old, upon which the heroes might be reassembled and once again directed toward human ends.
If the warrior order is permanently unmade over the course of the Iliad, it is upon the Shield of Achilles (XVIII.540–681) that the poet depicts a collective way of life closer to the historical experience and communal ethos of his late eighth- or seventh-century audience. The Shield is forged by Hephaestus, the god of craft, at the request of Thetis, Achilles’ mother. This new and immortal shield replaces Achilles’ prior shield, which he had given to his beloved Patroclus, who lost it—along with his life—in combat with Hector, the Trojan prince and defender. In a distillation of pure fury following the death of Patroclus, Achilles has resolved to return to battle to avenge the death of Patroclus, with the full knowledge that his return will necessitate his death at Troy. When the Dawn-goddess delivers the gift of the Shield down from Olympus to Achilles’ camp, his companions, upon seeing the images worked upon the Shield, are struck with fear and avert their gaze (XIX.16–18). They cannot look upon the “splendor” of the Shield, for in the depiction of the way of life there—which is that of the poet’s own audience—the heroes see their own obsolescence. Achilles, however, gazes long upon the brilliance of the Shield with a combination of adrenal anger and deep pleasure; his eyes gleam back in response, as if themselves afire. The vision that he sees upon the Shield—of a world without heroes, of a world without the relentless martial strife of the Iliad itself—is the source of a renewed, visceral anger for Achilles because it is a world whose possibilities are not meant for him. Yet the vision is also a source of pleasure to him because it is of a world that his own great paroxysm of killing rage in the final quarter of the poem will usher in. In his pleasure at the sight of the Shield, Achilles can, as it were, acknowledge his own role in the foundation of the world to come, even if his role is preeminently one of extraordinary negation: Achilles is the hero whose discontent fully lays bare the failures of the heroic order from the point of view of mortal happiness, while his surpassing strength permits him to make that discontent murderously actual, as he devastates much of the heroic order itself in the final books of the poem. His perfection is such that he is both the culmination and the destruction of the traditional form.
Among the images upon the Shield, it is the depiction of the wedding procession and, in the passage immediately following, of a communal process of adjudication in a case of murder that are foundational for the city-state (XVIII.554–560 and 560–574); both images appear on the second ring of the Shield, in the city at peace. In the wedding procession, the “high-blazing” torches illumine a scene of music and revelry; the sight provokes wonder: The promise of the wedding—which we do not see concluded, but always in motion—is one of social unity, the joining together and mutual strengthening of families withinn the city. In the Iliad itself, such unity is always in pieces, defended in speech even as it is sundered in action. The Achaean cause at Troy is, of course, the recovery of Helen, whose wedding to Menelaus is overturned by her flight, whether compelled or voluntary, to Troy. The martial expedition to Troy presents itself as a defense of the conjugal union and, by extension, of the social work that the wedding accomplishes—primarily, the joining together of families and the establishment of a new social unit that might, in turn, offer guest-friendship to others and to outsiders, thus creating further links of social exchange and comity. And yet, as Achilles complains with great and piercing sarcasm in book IX, the larger social principle epitomized by the defense of Helen and her marriage has been granted no general applicability, but seems to apply only to Agamemnon and Menelaus.
The Illiad, by Homer, is definitely one of the best books I have ever read. It actually is not necessarily a book; more like a poem. This poem-book tells of the legendary Trojan War between the Greeks and the Trojans. The whole thing kicked off when Hector ran away with the Greek king's daughter, Helen. They then fled to Troy with it's near impassable structured walls. Zeus brought back the news to Mount Olympus, place of the gods, and every god took up arguments for both sides. Half sided with Troy while the other half sided with the Greeks. As the Greeks battled with the Trojans, it became clear that they were losing. So they decided on a trick. A selected few men would hidee inside a great wooden horse, dubbed, the Trojan Horse. The Trojans would wheel the horse in think it was a great prize. When nightfall came, the men jumped out and !opened the gate for the whole Greek army to come in. Troy was defeated soundly and the book ends with the funeral of Hector. A ten out of ten!
I'm only a few chapters into the book, but by far, this is the greatest poem I've ever read. Homer combines drama, action, and mythology into one. This is definately reccomended.
The Iliad, as with other Greek poetry, was poetry intended to be recited orally as opposed to being read. Fitzgerald's backgroung in poetry brings out the lyrical passion of the Iliad so prized by the Greeks as no other translation has done.  Other translations are also hampered by archaic English language and idioms that make little sense today.  I strongly recommend this translation more than any other.
I bought this with the Sparknotes on The Illiad, which summarizes each 'book' (chapter) in the story. Once you have an idea of what's happening chapter by chapter, the book expands on the summary, and is really becomes an awesome read.    Homer can describe in vivid detail the combat sequences. Once you get past the fact that this version is written in it's poetic form, and you read it just like a regular prose version, you will enjoy it.    It is very affordable at under 8 bucks, so making notes, underlining parts that really strike you etc... won't make you feel like you are defacing anything.    It's a must for any library.
The Iliad is the story of the battle of Troy for a women named Helen who was taken captaive from here husband.  All of the Greek city states were involved in this war and many famous heroes.  The war lasted for 20 years and each side had many deaths.  Two of the most famous men who fought at Troy were Achilles and Odyseus these two men made sure that they won the battle and got Helen back.  They did not realise what a daunting task they would have infront of them until they arrived at Troy.  The walls were said to be 100 feet tall and 50 feet thick at most parts.  The battle of Troy is one of the most famous wars in all of history because of two things, it was the first to be over a women and have the gods help them in their victory.  Also that it had lasted so long and how strategic each side had fought in the war.
Well, it's funny when you refer to this as a book.  It actually is an epic. If lacking the knowledge of poetry, an epic is in fact a branch of poetry.  Overall, amazing, far better then the odyssey.
Love this book!  A must read for anyone who wants to understand where our epic tradition comes from - from the Bible and from Homer and Virgil.  As someone who recommends books to kids, this particular edition is a hard sell because of the dull cover.
The Iliad is definitely a must-read for anyone.  As a student, I was required to read this for my World Literature class.  As far as the mythology is concerned, it is absolutely fascinating, but even the historical perspective is amazing.  This epic poem is probably still THE standard for Greek mythology.
I picked up this book because I figured it would help to better understand the allusions and references in future novels. Not only did The Iliad help with this but it also was a great read. The introduction by King was informative and emphasized the transformation of war into art.
This book was confussing at first but after I look up some of the plots in the story I remembered seeing a movie about the Iliad. It was an incredible Book

For those itching to catch up on all six-and-a-half seasons of Mad Men ahead of the series finale this weekend, AMC is airing all 91 episodes in a row beginning Wednesday, May 13th, at 6 p.m. EST, Uproxx reports. Sidebar Watch 'Mad Men' Cast Say Roundtable Goodbyes » 
The Mad Men marathon will culminate with the finale, which airs Sunday, May 17th, at 10 p.m. ET. In a show of support, AMC's sister networks — BBC America, IFC, SundanceTV and WE tv — will go dark during the finale and air a special message commemorating the series. 
Also, after years of fostering an equal amount of fury and excitement with cryptic "Next week on Mad Men …" previews, AMC has offered up a heartwarming final promo clip . Set to Paul Anka's "Times of Your Life," the minute-long video traipses down memory lane, offering mostly lighthearted moments from the show's run, but also spotlighting the poignant, such as Don showing his kids the home he grew up in, Bert Cooper's soft-shoe farewell and Don and Peggy's slow dance at the end of "The Strategy."

" Epics aren't supposed to have satisfying endings," Sheffield writes. "That's what makes them epics — The Iliad ends with the Trojan War still raging, The Aeneid ends before Aeneas founds Rome and Mad Men is guaranteed to end before Don Draper finds happiness."

-=-=-TEXT: Study Guide Prepared by Michael J. Cummings...© 2003 
Revised in 2010 © 
 Type of Work
.......The Iliad is an epic poem, a long narrative work about heroic exploits that is elevated in tone and highly formal in its language. It was composed in ancient Greek and transmitted orally before it was written down. Many modern translators present the Iliad in prose, making it read like a novel. 
.......The Iliad derives the first two syllables of its name from Ilios or Ilion (Greek for Troy) or, alternately, from Ilium (Latin for Troy). The suffix -ad means related to, concerning, having to do with, or associated with. Thus, Iliad means a story concerning Troy. 
 Setting 
 Time of Action: About 3,200 years ago in recorded history's infancy, when humankind's imagination peopled the known world with great heroes and villains and nature reflected the mood of the gods inhabiting the mountaintops, the seas, the forests, and the unseen worlds above and below. Homer fashioned The Iliad, the story of the Trojan War, about 600 years after the war ended. The story is a mixture of fact, legend, and myth. 
Place of Action: The walled city of Troy and the surrounding plains in northwestern Anatolia, a region that is part of modern-day Turkey. Anatolia is west of Greece (across the Aegean Sea) and north of Egypt (across the Mediterranean Sea). 
.......In archeological digs between 1870 and 1890, German-born American archeologist Heinrich Schliemann (1822-1890) appeared to prove that the ancient city of Troy was a fact, not a myth, as many had thought. However, the story of the Trojan War~ez_mdash~as passed down to Homer~ez_mdash~was a mixture of fact, legend, and myth. 
 Iliad's Importance 
.......The Iliad ranks as one of the most important and most influential works in world literature in that it established literary standards and conventions that writers have imitated over the centuries, down to the present day. It also created archetypes that hundreds of great writers~ez_mdash~including Vergil, Dante, Shakespeare, Stephen Crane, and James Joyce~ez_mdash~alluded to when in need of an apt metaphor or simile. In addition, the Iliad provided a mother lode of information about Greek customs and ideals and about Greek mythology. The Iliad was a truly remarkable accomplishment. Even though its author had no similar literary model on which to base his work, he wrote a masterpiece that ranks with the greatest works of all time. No student of literature can ignore Homer. No writer's education is complete unless he has read Homer. 
 Verse Format 
.......The meter (rhythmic pattern of syllables) of Homer~ez_rsquo~s epic poems is dactylic hexameter. A dactyl is a metrical foot consisting of one accented syllable followed by two unaccented syllables, as in the words technical (TEK nik l), allocate (AL oh kate), and harbinger (HAR bin jer). Hexameter is a line containing six metrical feet. Thus, dactylic hexameter is a scheme containing six dactyls, as in the following line: MAKE me a BEAU ti ful GOWN and a HAT fringed with TASS les of DOWN, good sir. For a full detailed discussion and explanation of meter and its forms, click here. 
 The Homeric Epithet 
.......One of the hallmarks of the Homeric style is the epithet, a combination of a descriptive phrase and a noun. An epithet presents a miniature portrait that identifies a person or thing by highlighting a prominent characteristic of that person or thing. In English, the Homeric epithet usually consists of a noun modified by a compound adjective, such as the following: fleet-footed Achilles, rosy-fingered dawn, wine-dark sea, earth-shaking Poseidon, and gray-eyed Athena. The Homeric epithet is an ancient relative of such later epithets as Richard the Lion-Hearted, Ivan the Terrible, and America the Beautiful. Homer repeated his epithets often, presumably so the listeners of his recited tales could easily remember and picture the person or thing each time it was mentioned. In this respect, the Homeric epithet resembles the leitmotiv of opera composer Richard Wagner (1813-1883). The leitmotiv was a repeated musical theme associated with a character, a group of characters, an emotion, or an idea. 
.......Homer established literary practices, rules, or devices that became commonplace in epic poetry written later. These rules or devices are now known as epic conventions. They include the following: 
 Attitude Toward the Afterlife
.......The here and now concerns the Greeks at Troy more than the afterlife, for they generally believe that the abode of the dead is dark and dismal. Consequently, their main purpose in life is to achieve immediate rewards and to live for the moment. The idea of a heaven that will requite them for good deeds, whether on or off the battlefield, is of less importance to them. However, they generally do revere the gods of Olympus, who take sides in the war. Offending the gods could incur their wrath and affect the outcome of the war.  
Achilles: Temperamental Greek warrior and king of the Myrmidons, who were soldiers from Thessaly in Greece. Achilles, the protagonist, leads the Myrmidons against the Trojans.

 Themes
Theme 1:.The wrath of Achilles. The main focus of the Iliad is the anger of the Greek warrior Achilles and the revenge he seeks against those who wrong him, including the general of the Greek armies, Agamemnon, and the Trojan warriors.  
Theme 2:.Glory and honor are everything. The war begins because a Trojan offended Greek honor by absconding with the wife of a Greek king. The war continues~ez_mdash~for fully 10 years~ez_mdash~in part because the combatants seek glory on the battlefield. In this respect, the combatants are like modern athletes, actors, and politicians who compete for Heisman Trophies, Academy Awards, and votes. Achilles withdraws from battle on a point of honor; King Priam reclaims his son's body for the same reason. 
Theme 3:.Revenge. The Greeks seek revenge against the Trojans because one of the latter has taken the wife of a Greek king. Chryses and Apollo seek revenge because Agamemnon has defied them. Achilles seeks revenge against Agamemnon because the latter has insulted him. Later, after he reenters the battle, Achilles seeks revenge against the Trojans in general~ez_mdash~and Hector in particular~ez_mdash~for the death of Patroclus.  
Theme 4:.Persistence pays. For 10 years, the Greeks fight a foreign war. Although they long for their families, although they have lost many men, they refuse to abandon the battlefield. Ultimately, their pertinacity enables them to gain the upper hand, setting the stage for ultimate victory. 
Theme 5:.Women play important roles in motivating action and shaping the future. Helen is the immediate cause of the Trojan War. Chryseis is the cause of the rift between Agamemnon and Apollo's priest, Chryseis. Briseis is the cause of the rift between Agamemnon and Achilles. Athena, Aphrodite, Hera, and the sea-nymph mother of Achilles~ez_mdash~Thetis~ez_mdash~all affect the action of The Iliad significantly. Sometimes these goddesses get the better of their male counterparts. 
 Mythology Background
.......In the ancient Mediterranean world, feminine beauty reaches its zenith in Helen, wife of King Menelaus of Greece. Her wondrous face and body are without flaw. She is perfect. Even the goddess of love, Aphrodite, admires her. While Aphrodite competes with other goddesses in a beauty contest~ez_mdash~in which a golden apple is to be awarded as the prize~ez_mdash~she bribes the judge, a young Trojan named Paris. She promises him the most ravishing woman in the world, Helen, if he will select her, Aphrodite, as the most beautiful goddess. After winning the contest and receiving the coveted golden apple, she tells Paris about Helen and her incomparable pulchritude. Forthwith, Paris goes to Greece, woos Helen, and absconds with her to Troy, a walled city in Asia Minor (in present-day Turkey).  
.......The elopement is an affront to all the Greeks. How dare an upstart Trojan invade their land! How dare he steal the wife of one of their kings! Which Greek family would be next to fall victim to a Trojan machination? Infuriated, King Menelaus and his friends assemble a mighty army that includes the finest warriors in the land. Together, they cross the sea in one thousand ships to make war against Troy and win back their pride~ez_mdash~and Helen. But the war drags on and on. Weeks become months. Months become years. Years become a decade. It is in fact in the tenth year of the war that Homer picks up the thread of the story and spins his tale, focusing on a crisis in the Greek ranks in which the greatest soldier in history, Achilles, decides to withdraw from battle and allow his fellow Greeks to fend for themselves. It is Achilles who is the central figure in The Iliad. 
.......Homer begins with a one-paragraph invocation requesting the Muse (a goddess) to inspire him in the telling of his tale. Such an invocation was a convention in classical literature, notably in epics, from the time of Homer onward. 
Plot Summary 
.......Ten years have passed since the Greek armies arrived in Asia minor to lay waste Troy and win back their honor. Yet in all those years, neither side has gained enough advantage to force a surrender. The Greeks remain encamped outside the walls of the city, their nighttime fires mocking the glittering firmament while their generals plot stratagems and their warriors hone weapons.  
.......Among the Greek leaders, bloodstained and hardened to war, are Agamemnon, the commander-in-chief; Menelaus, king of Sparta and brother of Agamemnon; Odysseus, king of Ithaca and a military genius of unparalleled cunning; and Aias the Great, a giant warrior of colossal strength. With sword and spear, with rocks and fists, the Greeks have fought the Trojans~ez_mdash~led by the godlike Hector, their mightiest warrior, and Aeneas, a war machine second only to Hector on the Trojan side~ez_mdash~to a standoff. In time, the Greeks believe, they will prevail. They have right on their side, after all. But even more important, they have Achilles. He is the greatest warrior ever to walk the earth~ez_mdash~fierce, unrelenting, unconquerable. When Achilles fights, enemies cower in terror and rivers run with blood. No man can stand against him. Not Hector. Not an army of Hectors. 
.......But, alas, in the tenth year of the great war, Achilles refuses to fight after Agamemnon insults him. No one can offend the great Achilles with impunity. Not even Agamemnon, general of generals, who can whisper a command that ten thousand will obey. The rift between them opens after Agamemnon and Achilles capture two maidens while raiding the region around Troy. Agamemnon~ez_rsquo~s prize is Chryseis, the daughter of a priest of the god Apollo. For Achilles, there is the beautiful Briseis, who becomes his slave mistress.  
.......When Chryses, the father of Chryseis, offers a ransom for his daughter, Agamemnon refuses it. Chryses then invokes his patron, Apollo, for aid, and the sun god sends a pestilence upon the Greeks. Many soldiers die before Agamemnon learns the cause of their deaths from the soothsayer Calchas. Unable to wage war against disease, Agamemnon reluctantly surrenders Chryseis to her father.  
.......Unfortunately for the Greeks, the headstrong king then orders his men to seize Briseis as a replacement for his lost prize. Achilles is outraged. But rather than venting his wrath with his mighty sword, he retires from battle, vowing never again to fight for his countrymen. On his behalf, his mother, the sea nymph Thetis, importunes Zeus, king of the gods, to turn the tide of war in favor of the Trojans. Such a reversal would be fitting punishment for Agamemnon. But Zeus is reluctant to intervene in the war, for the other gods of Olympus have taken sides, actively meddling in daily combat. For him to support one army over the other would be to foment celestial discord. Among the deities favoring the Trojans are Ares, Aphrodite, Apollo, and Artemis. On the side of the Greeks are Athena, Poseidon, and Hera~ez_mdash~the wife of Zeus. There would be hell-raising in the heavens if Zeus shows partiality. In particular, his wife~ez_rsquo~s scolding tongue would wag without surcease. But Zeus is Zeus, god of thunder and lightning. In the end, he well knows, he can do as he pleases. Swayed by the pleas of Thetis, he confers his benisons on the Trojans.  
.......However, when the next battle rages, the Greeks~ez_mdash~fired with Promethean defiance and succored by their gods~ez_mdash~fight like madmen. True, their right arm, Achilles, is absent; but their left arm becomes a scythe that reaps a harvest of Trojans. Aias and Diomedes are especially magnificent. Only intervention by the Trojans~ez_rsquo~ Olympian supporters save them from massacre. Alas, however, when the Trojans regroup for the next fight, Zeus infuses new power into Hector~ez_rsquo~s sinews. After Hector bids a tender goodbye to his wife, Andromache, and little boy, Astyanax, he leads a fierce charge that drives the Greeks all the way back to within sight of the shoreline, where they had started ten years before. Not a few Greeks, including Agamemnon, are ready to board their ships and set sail for home. Such has been the fury of the Hector-led onslaught.  
.......Then Nestor, a wise old king of three score and ten, advises Agamemnon to make peace with Achilles. The proud commander, now repentant and fully acknowledging his unjust treatment of Achilles, accepts the advice and pledges to restore Briseis to Achilles. When representatives of Agamemnon meet with lordly Achilles, the great warrior is idly passing time with the person he loves most in the world, his friend Patroclus, a distinguished warrior in his own right. Told that all wrongs against him will be righted, Achilles~ez_mdash~still smoldering with anger~ez_mdash~spurns the peace-making overture. His wrath is unquenchable. However, Patroclus, unable to brook the Trojan onslaught against his countrymen, borrows the armor of Achilles and, at the next opportunity, enters the battle disguised as Achilles.  
.......The stratagem works for a while as Patroclus chops and hacks his way through the Trojan ranks. But eventually Hector~ez_rsquo~s spear fells brave Patroclus with no small help from meddlesome Apollo. The Trojan hero celebrates the kill with an audacious coup de grâce: He removes and puts on Achilles~ez_rsquo~ armor. Grievously saddened by the death of his friend and outraged at the brazen behavior of Hector, wrathful Achilles~ez_mdash~with a new suit of armor forged in Olympus by Hephaestus at the behest of Achilles' mother, Thetis~ez_mdash~agrees to rejoin the fight at long last.  
.......The next day, Achilles rules the battlefield with death and destruction, cutting a swath of terror through enemy ranks. Trojan blood mulches the fields. Limbs lie helter-skelter, broken and crooked, as fodder for diving raptors. Terrified, the Trojans flee to the safety of Troy and its high walls~ez_mdash~all of them, that is, except Hector. Foolishly, out of his deep sense of honor and responsibility as protector of Troy, he stands his ground. In a fairy tale about a noble hero with an adoring wife and son, Hector would surely have won the day against a vengeful, all-devouring foe. His compatriots~ez_mdash~and the gallery of sons and daughters and wives peering down from the Trojan bulwarks~ez_mdash~would surely have crowned him king. But in the brutal world of Achilles~ez_mdash~whose ability to disembowel and decapitate is a virtue~ez_mdash~Hector suffers a humiliating death. After Achilles chases and catches him, he easily slays him, then straps his carcass to his chariot and drags him around the walls of Troy. Patroclus has been avenged, the Greeks have reclaimed battlefield supremacy, and victory seems imminent. 
.......However, old Priam, the king of Troy and the father of Hector, shows that Trojan valor has not died with Hector. At great risk to himself, he crosses the battlefield in a chariot and presents himself to Achilles to claim the body of his son. But there is no anger in Priam's heart. He understands the ways of wars and warriors. He knows that Achilles, the greatest of the Greek soldiers, had no choice but to kill his son, the greatest of the Trojan warriors. Humbly, Priam embraces Achilles and gives him his hand. Deeply moved, Achilles welcomes Priam and orders an attendant to prepare Hector's body. To spare Priam the shock of seeing the grossly disfigured corpse, Achilles orders the attendant to cloak it. Troy mourns Hector for nine days, then burns his body and puts the remains in a golden urn that is buried in a modest grave.  
.......(The Iliad ends here. Homer's audience was aware of the outcome of the war: the defeat and destruction of Troy by the Greeks. When Troy fell, so did Achilles~ez_mdash~from the wound of arrow shot by Paris and guided by the god Apollo. In his other great epic, the Odyssey, Homer tells the story of the Greek hero Odysseus on his harrowing sea voyage home from Troy.)  
 Essay Topics and Discussion Questions
Compare/Contrast Achilles and Hector 
.......Achilles and Hector are alike in some ways but different in many others. For example, each is the greatest warrior of his army~ez_mdash~Achilles, the Greek champion, and Hector, the Trojan champion. In addition, both exhibit human flaws~ez_mdash~Achilles, vengeful rage, and Hector, impetuosity, as when he persuades Trojan warriors to leave the safety of Troy's walls shortly before Achilles returns to battle. However, they are unlike in many ways. Whereas Hector is a loving family man, Achilles has no wife or children. He seeks only one thing: battlefield glory. Write an informative essay or hold a discussion that compares and contrasts Achilles and Hector. Consider their personalities, their motivations, their intelligence, their leadership qualities, their relationships and standing with those around them, their skills as soldiers, their physical characteristics, and their moral and ethical values. 
Conflict 
.......Is the central conflict of the Iliad an internal or external one~ez_mdash~that is, does the epic concern itself more with a conflict inside a person (or persons) or more with a conflict outside of a person (or persons) him, such as the war?  
Character You Admire or Despise 
.......Which character do you most admire? Which character do you least admire? Is your selection based on qualities the character shares with you or on qualities of the character that you would like to have but lack? Overall, what does your choice say about your own personality and characteristics?  
The Role of Women 
Investigate and report on the role of women in ancient Mediterranean society. Does the treatment of women by Agamemnon, Achilles, Paris, Hector, or any other character reflect the prevailing values of ancient society in Greece and nearby lands? 
The Trojan War 
.......How much of the Trojan War, as presented by Homer, is fact and how much legend or myth? As a starting point, look up the name Heinrich Schliemann (or Henry Schliemann) on the Internet or in an encyclopedia. Schliemann (1822-1890), who changed his first name to Henry after moving from his native Germany to America, conducted archeological digs in Turkey (the country where the fabled city was said to be located) in an attempt to prove that Troy really existed. What he found startled the world. 
.......Encyclopedias and mythology books generally list twelve deities as the chief gods in Greek mythology  and as residents of Mount Olympus. However, two of these important deities spent most of their time in the domains which they governed, the sea and the underworld. In addition, the Greeks of one era sometimes differed with the Greeks of another era on who were the most important gods. Consequently, the list of the favored twelve sometimes changed, omitting one god in favor of another. 
.......The Olympian gods were the successors of an earlier dynasty of gods known as Titans. The Titan ruler, Cronos, believing that one of his children might attempt to overthrow him, swallowed each of them after his or her birth. However, one child, Zeus, was rescued by his mother and hidden on the island of Crete. Later, Zeus forced his father to vomit the other children from his stomach. Then, with the help of his siblings, he overthrew Cronus to become lord of the universe.  
.......The names of the chief Olympian deities are listed below. Writers in ancient Greece~ez_mdash~such as Sophocles, Aeschylus, and Euripides~ez_mdash~used the original Greek names, the English transliteration of which appears at left in the list. Writers in ancient Rome and its dominions used the Latin version of the names, the English transliteration of which appears in parentheses.  
.......Some English language writers, past and present, use the transliteration of the Greek version; others prefer the transliteration of the Latin (or Roman) version. For example, William Shakespeare uses the transliteration of the Latin version in his plays and poems. Instead of referring to the king of the gods as Zeus (the transliteration of the Greek name), he refers to him as Jupiter and Jove, the transliterations of the Latin names (Iuppiter and Iovis). Here are the names of the Olympian gods and a brief description of each:. 
  The Abode of the Gods
.......The Olympian gods lived in palaces constructed by Hephaestus on the summit of Mount Olympus, the highest peak (9,570 feet) in a mountain range between Macedonia and Thessaly near the Aegean Sea. Mount Olympus is sometimes called Upper Olympus because it lies just north of a lesser peak (5,210 feet) known as Lower Olympus.  
.......Minor goddesses called the Seasons maintained watch at the entranceway of Mount Olympus, a gate of clouds which opened and closed whenever a god left or returned to Olympus.  
.......In their lofty domain, the gods breathed only pure air, or ether. They took their meals in the palace of Zeus, eating ambrosia to sustain eternal life and drinking a delicious beverage called nectar, served by Hebe. Near the throne of Zeus sat lesser goddesses known as Muses, who were nine in number. They regaled the gathering with songs of the gods and of earthly heroes and history. These daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory, learned under the tutelage of Apollo.  
.......Other lesser gods on Olympus included the following: (1) Eros (Cupid), god of love and son of Aphrodite who shot arrows that impregnated humans with love. (2) Iris, messenger goddess of Zeus and Hera who created rainbows when she flew across the sky. (3) Themis, a companion of Zeus who was the goddess of justice. She holds scales on which she weighs the claims in a suit of law. (4) The Charites, or Graces, goddesses of joy and beauty. (5) Nemesis, the goddess of vengeance and punishment. (6) Aidos, the goddess of conscience...... 
.......Since ancient times, western literature has lived at the foot of Mount Olympus, the nearly two-mile high colossus that was believed to be home to important Greek gods. Writers of every age and every genre have invoked the magic of Olympus to make fire and thunder with words~ez_mdash~or to perfume them with the breath of Venus. 
.......The Greek writers Hesiod (born in the 7th or 8th Century B.C.) and Homer (born in the 8th or 9th Century B.C.) immortalized the Olympian gods~ez_mdash~Hesiod in the Theogony and in Works and Days, Homer in The Iliad and The Odyssey. The Theogony presents a creation myth and a genealogy of the gods, along with accounts of their exploits. The Works and Days advises farmers how to prosper, through honest toil and righteous living, without incurring the disfavor of the gods. Homer~ez_rsquo~s Iliad tells the story of the final year of the Trojan War, between Greece and Troy, focusing on the greatest Greek warrior, Achilles, and on the machinations of Olympian gods who take sides and attempt to influence the outcome of the war. The Odyssey narrates the adventures of Odysseus (known as Ulysses to the Romans), a hero of the war who designed the famous Trojan horse to breach the walls of Troy, on his long sea voyage home after the war. While sailing home, the Olympian gods alternately help or hinder his progress. The Iliad and The Odyssey, both epic poems, are among the greatest works in world literature.  
.......Every great writer since Hesiod and Homer~ez_mdash~including Sophocles, Vergil, Ovid, Dante, Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milton~ez_mdash~has climbed Olympus to retrieve metaphorical divinities or one of their qualities to illumine, clarify, or beautify his or her language. 
.......Though everlasting and supernal, the gods of Olympus exhibited humanlike behavior. They could be loving and generous, wise and forbearing. They could also be petty and base, fickle and vile. And, they could be quick to anger. In Book I of The Iliad, the Olympian god Apollo descends the great mountain in a rage after the Greek general Agamemnon captures a beautiful maiden and refuses to give her up to her father, Chryses, a priest of Apollo. 
[Apollo] came down furious from the summits of Olympus, with his bow and his quiver upon his shoulder, and the arrows rattled on his back with the rage that trembled within him. He sat himself down away from the ships with a face as dark as night, and his silver bow rang death as he shot his arrow in the midst of them. First he smote their mules and their hounds, but presently he aimed his shafts at the people themselves, and all day long the pyres of the dead were burning. (English translation by.Samuel Butler)
The gods could also be quick to laugh. In Book 8 of The Odyssey, the blacksmith god, Hephaestus (Vulcan)~ez_mdash~a lame and ugly hunchback~ez_mdash~fashions an invisible chain to ensnare his beautiful wife, Aphrodite (Venus), and her inamorato, Ares (Mars), after they rendezvous to make love. In bed, they become hopelessly entangled in the chain. Hephaestus then invites other gods to look upon his unfaithful wife and her paramour caught~ez_mdash~like wasps in a spider~ez_rsquo~s web~ez_mdash~in his trap. 
On this the gods gathered to the house of Vulcan. Earth-encircling Neptune came, and Mercury the bringer of luck, and King Apollo. . . . Then the givers of all good things stood in the doorway, and the blessed gods roared with inextinguishable laughter, as they saw how cunning Vulcan had been. . . . (English translation by Samuel Butler)

-=-=-SNIPPET:  AI Systems in Clinical Practice, Iliad, Medical diagnosis in internal medicine
-=-=-TEXT: "   We present the implementation of the indications for surgery for three surgical operations--cholecystectomy, cataract extraction, and knee arthroscopy--in a medical expert system, called Iliad. This implementation operates in the preauthorization service of IHC Health Plans (an insurance company in Salt Lake City) as a basis for reimbursement of services. Patient data collection forms, derived from Iliad knowledge base, were used by 13 participating surgeons to document the objective patient observations that justify the surgery and, then were faxed to IHC where a trained nurse input the data in Iliad. Iliad's decisions and reports on any deviations from guidelines are communicated back to the care provider. The study evaluates the impact of the computerized implementation on process, as measured by a questionnaire, and on outcome as measured by rate of approvals, documentation level, rate of requests, and average cost. The prospective implementation of the computerized guidelines has performed reliably, has been perceived as a preferred alternative to the old preauthorization system, and, most importantly, has enhanced significantly the level of documentation permitting evaluation and determination of appropriateness before surgery. "
"   The influence of uncertainty on physicians' practice behavior is not well understood. In this research, ILIAD, a diagnostic expert system, has been used to study physicians' responses to uncertainty and how their responses affected clinical performance. The simulation mode of ILIAD was used to standardize the presentation and scoring of two cases to 46 residents in emergency medicine, internal medicine, family practice and transitional medicine at Methodist Hospital of Indiana. A questionnaire was used to collect additional data on how physicians respond to clinical uncertainty. A structural equation model was developed, estimated, and tested. The results indicate that stress that physicians experience in dealing with clinical uncertainty has a negative effect on their clinical performance. Moreover, the way that physicians respond to uncertainty has positive and negative effects on their performance. Open discussions with patients about clinical decisions and the use of practice guidelines improves performance. However, when the physician's clinical decisions are influenced by patient demands or their peers, their performance scores decline. "

(Boursier.com) — LA TENDANCE 
Le rebond se confirme, avec un CAC40 qui refranchi les 5.000 points, en hausse de 1,25% ce mercredi à 5.035 pts. La séance du jour est placée sous le signe macro économique avec le PIB français qui est ressorti à +0,6% au premier trimestre, ce qui constitue une bonne surprise, alors que le PIB allemand est à +0,3% seulement. De façon générale, les marchés restent volatils après leur démarrage 2015 tonitruant et la phase de consolidation engagée depuis plusieurs séances semble logique et justifiée aux yeux de nombreux observateurs. Qui plus est motivée par la perspective de cessation de paiement de la Grèce... 
ECO ET DEVISES 
La croissance française a donc nettement accéléré au premier trimestre, le PIB progressant de 0,6% par rapport au trimestre précédent, après seulement +0,1% au 4ème trimestre 2014, a annoncé mercredi l'Insee. Il s'agit de la meilleure performance de l'économie française depuis le 2ème trimestre 2013, lorsque le PIB avait augmenté de 0,7%.Les prix à la consommation ont progressé de 0,1% en avril après avoir augmenté de 0,7% le mois précédent, annonce l'Insee. Un niveau en ligne avec les attentes des économistes. En glissement annuel, l'inflation atteint également 0,1% après trois mois consécutifs de baisse (-0,1% en mars, -0,3% en février et -0,4% en janvier). La légère hausse des prix à la consommation provient surtout de l'augmentation, en partie saisonnière, des prix de certains services et produits manufacturés et du renchérissement des produits pétroliers. Globalement, les prix de l'alimentation sont stables.En Allemagne, le taux d'inflation, harmonisé aux normes européennes, a été confirmé à 0,3% en avril par l'Office fédéral de la statistique. En séquentiel, les prix à la consommation affichent un repli de 0,1%. L'indice calculé aux normes allemandes est de son côté ressorti inchangé sur un mois et en hausse de 0,5% sur un an, après avoir été annoncé à respectivement -0,1% et +0,4% en première estimation. 
Aux Etats-Unis, on attend les ventes de détail d'avril (14h30 : consensus +0,2% m/m), les prix à l'import et à l'export d'avril (14h30), l'indice des anticipations d'inflation de la Fed d'Atlanta (16h00), les stocks et ventes des entreprises américaines (16h00) et le rapport hebdomadaire concernant les stocks pétroliers domestiques américains (16h30).La parité euro / dollar atteint 1,1240 ce midi. Le baril de Brent se négocie 67,25$ et le WTI 61,25$ pour l'échéance de juin. 
VALEURS EN HAUSSE 
* Canal+ : +19% à 7,60 Euros. Le titre s'envole et s'aligne sur l'offre proposée par Vivendi, rendue publique hier soir. Détenant 48,5% du capital de SECP, le groupe présidé par Vincent Bolloré précise que cette opération est rendue possible par la loi de 2009 qui autorise sous certaines conditions l'évolution de l'actionnariat au sein d'un diffuseur TV. La décision du Conseil de surveillance de Vivendi intervient à la demande d'un nombre important de ses actionnaires, selon le communiqué. 
* Numericable-SFR : s'envole de 10% à 57 euros dans le sillage de sa publication trimestrielle et d'avis de brokers favorables... Au 1er trimestre 2015, le groupe a réalisé un chiffre d'affaires de 2,74 milliards d'euros en baisse de 4,6%, repli essentiellement dû à l'érosion des revenus du mobile, tant sur le segment du résidentiel que celui de l'entreprise, mais l'Ebitda ajusté est ressorti en hausse de 21% à 930 millions d'euros. Au 31 mars, le résultat net du groupe s'est élevé à 816 ME. Parmi les analystes, Natixis change d'opinion en soulignant "la bonne surprise de la guidance" : "Le groupe a publié hier des résultats trimestriels supérieurs aux attentes. Nous relevons assez significativement nos estimations d'EBITDA sur 2015/2017 et adoptons une opinion Acheter (contre Alléger) avec un objectif de 64,2 euros, contre 49,9 euros auparavant. La SG reste quant à elle à l'achat en visant plus haut, soit 62 euros, et Goldman Sachs (achat) est encore plus gourmand en ciblant 65 euros... Quant à Oddo, ce dernier voit "peu de catalyseurs positifs à court terme, mais de fortes synergies dès le T1", d'où un avis à l'achat maintenu et des estimations relevées. La croissance des résultats a ainsi permis à Numericable de relever de son objectif de rentabilité à moyen terme.

-=-=-TITLE:  Heroes and the Homeric Iliad
-=-=-SNIPPET:  The Iliad seems to make up for its avoidance of details concerning the sacrifices of animals by dwelling on details concerning the martial deaths of heroes. In ...
-=-=-TEXT: 1. Admired through the ages as the    ultimate epic, Homer's Iliad, along with its    companion-piece, the Odyssey, was venerated by the ancient    Greeks themselves as the cornerstone of their    civilization.1 By force of its prestige, the    Iliad sets the standard for the definition of the word    epic: an expansive poem of enormous scope, composed in an    archaic and superbly elevated style of language, concerning the    wondrous deeds of heroes. That these deeds were meant to arouse a    sense of wonder or marvel is difficult for the modern mind to    comprehend, especially in a time when even such words as    wonderful or marvelous have lost much of their    evocative power. Nor is it any easier to grasp the ancient Greek    concept of hero (the English word is descended from the    Greek), going beyond the word's ordinary levels of meaning in    casual contemporary usage.2
2. What, then, were the heroes of the    Iliad? In ancient Greek myth, heroes were humans, male or    female, of the remote past, endowed with superhuman abilities and    descended from the immortal gods themselves.3 The prime    example is Akhilleus, more commonly known as Achilles in the    English tradition. This, the greatest hero of the Iliad,    was the son of Thetis, a sea-goddess known for her far-reaching    cosmic powers.
3. It is clear in the epic, however,    that the father of Achilles is mortal, and that this greatest of    heroes must therefore be mortal as well. So also with all the    ancient Greek stories of the heroes: even though they are all    descended in some way or another from the gods, however many    generations removed, heroes are mortals, subject to death. No    matter how many immortals you find in a family tree, the intrusion    of even a single mortal will make all successive descendants    mortal. Mortality, not immortality, is the dominant    gene.
4. In some stories, true, the gods    themselves can bring it about that the hero becomes miraculously    restored to life after death - a life of immortality. The story of    Herakles, who had been sired by Zeus, the chief of all the gods,    is perhaps the most celebrated instance.4 But even in    such a case, the hero has to die first. It is only after the most    excruciating pains, culminating in his death at the funeral pyre    on the peak of Mount Oeta, that Herakles is at long last admitted    to the company of immortals. In short, the hero can be    immortalized, but the fundamental painful fact remains: the    hero is not by nature immortal.
Addendum: the Odyssey is the    most extended narrative about immortalization. But it happens only    on a symbolic level. The Odyssey makes it clear that    Odysseus will have to die, even if it happens in a prophecy,    beyond the framework of the surface narrative.
5. The gods themselves are exempt    from this ultimate pain of death. When the god Ares goes through    the motions of death after he is taken off guard and wounded by    the mortal Diomedes in Scroll 5 of the Iliad, we detect a    touch of humor in the Homeric treatment of the scene, owing to the    fact that this particular "death" is a mock death.5 In    the world of epic, the dead seriousness of death can be    experienced only by humans.
6. Mortality is the dominant theme in    the stories of ancient Greek heroes, and the Iliad and    Odyssey are no exception. Mortality is the burning question    for the heroes of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and for    Achilles and Odysseus in particular. The human condition of    mortality, with all its ordeals, defines heroic life itself. The    certainty that one day you will die makes you human, distinct from    animals who are unaware of their future death and from the    immortal gods. All the ordeals of the human condition culminate in    the ultimate ordeal of a warrior hero's violent death in battle,    detailed in all its ghastly varieties by the poet of the    Iliad.
7. This deep preoccupation with the    primal experience of violent death in war has several possible    explanations. Some argue that the answer has to be sought in the    simple fact that ancient Greek society accepted war as a necessary    and even important part of life.6 Others seek a deeper    answer by pointing to the poet's awe-struck sense of    uncontrollable forces at work in the universe, even of a    personified concept of Force itself, which then becomes, through    the poet's own artistic powers, some kind of eerie esthetic    thing.
8. But there are other answers as    well, owing to approaches that delve deeply into the role of    religion and, more specifically, into the religious practices of    hero-worship and animal-sacrifice in ancient Greece. Of particular    interest is the well-attested Greek custom of worshipping a hero    precisely by way of slaughtering a sacrificial animal, ordinarily    a ram.
9. There is broad cultural evidence    suggesting that hero-worship in ancient Greece was not created out    of stories like that of the Iliad and    Odyssey but was in fact independent of them. The    stories, on the other hand, were based on the religious practices,    though not always directly. There are even myths that draw into an    explicit parallel the violent death of a hero and the sacrificial    slaughter of an animal. For example, the description of the death    of the hero Patroklos in Scroll 18 of the Iliad parallels    in striking detail the stylized description, documented    elsewhere in Homeric poetry (Odyssey Scroll 3), of the    slaughter of a sacrificial bull: in both cases, the victim is    first stunned and disoriented by a fatal blow from behind, then    struck frontally by another fatal blow, and then finally    administered the coup de grâce. For another example, we may    consider an ancient Greek vase-painting that represents the same    heroic warrior Patroklos in the shape of a sacrificial ram lying    supine with its legs in the air and its throat slit open    (lettering next to the painted figure specifies    Patroklos).7
10. Evidence also places these    practices of hero-worship and animal-sacrifice precisely during    the era when the stories of the Iliad and    Odyssey took shape. Yet, curiously enough, we    find practically no mention there of hero-worship and very little    detailed description of animal-sacrifice. Homeric poetry, as a    medium that achieved its general appeal to the Greeks by virtue of    avoiding the parochial concerns of specific locales or regions,    tended to avoid realistic descriptions of any ritual, not just    ritual sacrifice.    This pattern of avoidance is to    be expected, given that any ritual tends to be a localized    phenomenon in ancient Greece.
11. What sacrificial scenes we    do find in the epics are markedly stylized, devoid of the kind of    details that characterize real sacrifices as documented in    archaeological and historical evidence. In real sacrifice the    parts of the animal victim's body correspond to the members of the    body politic. The ritual dismemberment of the animal's body in    sacrifice sets a mental pattern for the idea of the reassembly of    the hero's body in myths of immortalization. Given, then, that    Homeric poetry avoids delving into the details of dismemberment as    it applies to animals, in that it avoids the details of    sacrificial practice, we may expect a parallel avoidance of the    topic of immortalization for the hero. The local practices of    hero-worship, contemporaneous with the evolution of Homeric poetry    as we know it, are clearly founded on religious notions of heroic    immortalization.
12. While personal immortalization is    thus too localized in orientation for epics, the hero's death in    battle, in all its stunning varieties, is universally acceptable.    The Iliad seems to make up for its avoidance of details    concerning the sacrifices of animals by dwelling on details    concerning the martial deaths of heroes. In this way Homeric    poetry, with its staggering volume of minutely detailed    descriptions of the deaths of warriors, can serve as a    compensation for sacrifice itself.
13. Such deep concerns about the    human condition are organized by Homeric poetry in a    framework of heroic portraits, with those of Achilles and Odysseus    serving as the centerpieces of the Iliad and Odyssey    respectively. Let us begin with Achilles. Here is a monolithic and    fiercely uncompromising man who actively chooses violent death    over life in order to win the glory of being remembered forever in    epic poetry (Iliad 9.413). Here is a man of unbending    principle who cannot allow his values to be compromised - not even    by the desperate needs of his near and dear friends who are    begging him to bend his will, bend it just enough to save his own    people. Here is a man of constant sorrow, who can never forgive    himself for having unwittingly allowed his nearest and dearest    friend, Patroklos, to take his place in battle and be killed in    his stead, slaughtered like a sacrificial animal - all on account    of his own refusal to bend his will by coming to the aid of his    fellow warriors. Here is a man, finally, of unspeakable anger, an    anger so intense that the poet words it the same way that he words    the anger of the gods, even of Zeus himself.
14. The gods of Homer's Iliad    take out their anger actively, as in the poet's descriptions of    the destructive fire unleashed by the thunderbolt of Zeus. The    central hero of the Iliad at first takes out his anger    passively, by withdrawing his vital presence from his own people.    The hero's anger is directed away from the enemy and toward his    own people, whose king, Agamemnon, has insulted Achilles' honor    and demeaned his sense of self. This passive anger of Achilles    translates into the active success of the enemy in the hero's    absence, and the enemy's success is compared, ironically, to the    destructive fire unleashed by the thunderbolt of Zeus. In this    way, the passive anger of the hero translates symbolically into    the active anger of the god. Then, in response to the death of    Patroklos, Achilles' anger modulates into an active phase - active    no longer in a symbolic but in a real sense. The hero's anger is    redirected, away from his own people and back toward his    enemy.
15. This new phase of Achilles' anger    consumes the hero in a paroxysm of self-destructiveness.    His fiery rage plummets him to the depths of brutality, as he    begins to view the enemy as the ultimate Other, to be hated with    such an intensity that Achilles can even bring himself, in a    moment of ultimate fury, to express that most ghastly of desires,    to eat the flesh of Hektor, the man he is about to kill. The    Iliad is the story of a hero's pain, culminating in an    anger that degrades him to the level of a savage animal, to the    depths of bestiality. This same pain, however, this same intense    feeling of loss, will ultimately make the savage anger subside in    a moment of heroic self-recognition that elevates Achilles to the    highest realms of humanity, of humanism. At the end of the    Iliad, as he begins to recognize the pain of his deadliest    enemy, of the Other, he begins to achieve a true recognition of    the Self. The anger is at an end. And the story can end as    well.
16. We find the poet's own statement    about the subject of the Iliad in the original Greek poem's    very first word: Anger. The song of the Iliad - for at the    time, poets were singers, performers, and their poems were sung -    is about the anger, the doomed and ruinous anger, of the hero    Achilles. The singer was following the rules of his craft in    summing up the whole song, all 100,000 or so words, in one    single word, the first word of the song. So also in the    Odyssey, the first word, Man, tells the subject of the    song. There the singer calls upon the Muse, goddess of the special    Memory that makes him a singer, to tell him the story of the Man,    the many-sided man, the hero Odysseus, who wandered so many    countless ways in his voyages at sea after his heroic exploit of    masterminding the capture and destruction of Troy. The Muse is    imagined as telling the singer his song, and the singer can then    sing this song to others. In the same way, here in the    Iliad, the singer calls upon the Goddess to tell the story    of the Anger, the doomed and ruinous anger, of the hero Achilles,    which caused countless losses and woes for Greeks and Trojans    alike in the war that later culminated in the destruction of    Troy.
17. We see from this paraphrase of    the beginnings of both the Iliad and the Odyssey    that the rules of the singer's craft extend beyond the naming of    the main subject with the first word. In the original Greek of    both the Iliad and the Odyssey, the first word    announcing the subject - Anger, Man - is followed by a specially    chosen adjective setting the mood - doomed anger, many-sided man -    to be followed in turn by a relative clause that frames the story    by outlining the plot - the doomed anger that caused countless    losses and woes, the many-sided man who wandered countless    ways.
18. The symmetry of these two    monumental compositions, the Iliad and Odyssey, goes    beyond their strict adherence to the rules of introducing an    ancient Greek song. For they counterbalance each other throughout    their vast stretches of narrative, in a steady rhythmic flow of    verses, lines called dactylic hexameters (the Iliad    contains over 15,000 lines and the Odyssey, over    12,000). The counterbalancing focuses on the central plot and the    characterization of the principal hero in each. Achilles'    monolithic personality, that of the mightiest warrior of his era    who was monumentally proud of his martial exploits and his    physical prowess, is matched against the many-sidedness of    Odysseus, famed for his crafty stratagems and cunning    intelligence.
19a. The symmetry of the Iliad    and Odyssey goes even further: between the two of them,    these two songs give the impression of incorporating most of    whatever was worth retelling about the heroic age - at least from    the standpoint of the Greeks in the Classical period of the fifth    century BCE and thereafter. The staggering comprehensiveness of    these two songs is apparent even from a cursory glance. For    example, the Iliad not only tells the story that it says it    will tell, about Achilles' anger and how it led to countless woes    as the Greeks went on fighting it out with the Trojans and    striving to ward off the fiery onslaught of Hektor. It also    manages to retell or even relive, though with varying degrees of    directness or fullness of narrative, the entire Tale of Troy,    including from the earlier points of the story-line such memorable    moments as the Judgment of Paris, the Abduction of Helen, and the    Assembly of Ships. More than that: the Iliad foreshadows    the Death of Achilles, which does not occur within the bounds of    its own plot. In short, although the story of the Iliad    directly covers only a short stretch of the whole story of    Troy, thereby resembling the compressed time-frame of Classical    Greek tragedy (Aristotle makes this observation in his    Poetics), it still manages to mention something about    practically everything that happened at Troy, otherwise known as    Ilion. Hence the epic's title - the Tale of Ilion, the    Iliad.
19b. The Odyssey adds much more,    especially about the so-called Epic Cycle. It even features the    story of the Trojan Horse in viii.
20. For the Greeks of the fifth    century BCE and thereafter, the Iliad and Odyssey,    these two seemingly all-inclusive and symmetrical songs, were the    creation of the Master Singer called Homer, reputed to have lived    centuries earlier. Homer was presumed to be contemporaneous with    another Master Singer called Hesiod, who was credited with two    other definitive symmetrical songs, the Theogony and the    Works and Days. About the real Homer, there is next to    nothing that we can recover from the ancient world. Nor do we have    much better luck with Hesiod, except perhaps for whatever the    singer says about himself in his own two songs. In the case of    Homer, we do not even have this much to start with, at least not    in the Iliad or the Odyssey: in neither song does    the singer say anything about himself that could be construed as    historical information. It can even be said that there is no    evidence for the existence of a Homer - and hardly that much more    for the existence of a Hesiod.
21. What we do know for sure,    however, is that the Greeks of the Classical period thought of    Homer and Hesiod as their first authors, their primary authors. So    it is not only for the modern reader that Homer and Hesiod    represent the earliest phase of Greek literature. It is moreover a    historical fact that Homer and Hesiod were eventually credited by    the ancient Greeks with the very foundation of Greek literature.    Our primary authority for this fact is none other than the    so-called Father of History himself, Herodotus, who observes in    Scroll II (53.1-3) of his Histories that Homer and Hesiod,    by way of their songs, had given the Greeks their first definitive    statement about the gods. In a traditional society like that of    the ancient Greeks, where the very idea of defining the gods is    the equivalent of defining the society itself, this observation by    Herodotus amounts to a claim that the songs of Homer and Hesiod    are the basis of Greek civilization.
22. Who, then, was Homer? It is no    exaggeration to answer that, along with Hesiod, he had become the    prime culture hero of Greek civilization in the Classical period    of the fifth century and thereafter. It was a common practice of    the ancient Greeks to attribute any major achievement of society,    even if this achievement may have taken place through a lengthy    period of social evolution, to the personal breakthrough of a    culture hero who was pictured as having made his monumental    contribution in the earliest imaginable era of the culture. Greek    myths about lawgivers, for example, tended to reconstruct these    figures, whether or not they really ever existed, as the    originators of the sum total of customary law as it evolved    through time. The same sort of evolutionary model may well apply    to the figure of Homer as an originator of heroic song.
23. The model can even be extended    from Homer to Homeric song. There is evidence that a type of    story, represented in a wide variety of cultures where the    evolution of a song tradition moves slowly ahead in time until it    reaches a relatively static phase, reinterprets itself as if it    resulted from a single event. There were many such stories about    Homer in ancient Greece, and what matters most is not so much the    stories themselves but what they reveal about society's need to    account for the evolution of Homeric song. The internal evidence    of the Homeric verses, both in their linguistic development and in    their datable references, points to an ongoing evolution of    Homeric song embracing a vast stretch of time that lasted perhaps    as long as a thousand years, extending from the second millennium    BCE. This period culminated in a static phase that lasted about    two centuries, framed by a formative stage in the later part of    the eighth century BCE, where the epic was taking on its present    shape, and a definitive stage, in the middle of the sixth, where    the epic reached its final form.
24. The basic historical fact    remains, in any case, that the figure of Homer had become, by the    Classical period of the fifth century BCE, a primary culture hero    credited with the creation of the Iliad and Odyssey.    Little wonder, then, that so many Greek cities - Athens included -    claimed to be his birthplace. Such rivalry for the possession of    Homer points to the increasingly widespread refinement of his    identity through the cultural significance of Homeric    song.
25. Of course the subject of the    Iliad is not just the Anger of Achilles in particular and    the age of heroes in general. The Iliad purports to say    everything that is worth saying about the Greeks - the Hellenes,    as they called themselves in the Classical period. Not that the    Iliad calls them Greeks. The Greeks in this song are a    larger-than-life cultural construct of what they imagined    themselves to have been in the distant age of heroes. These Greeks    are retrojected Greeks, given such alternative Homeric names as    Achaeans, Argives, Danaans, all three of    which are used interchangeably to refer to these heroic ancestors    whose very existence in song is for the Greeks the basis for their    own self-definition as a people. It is as if the Iliad, in    mirroring for the Greeks of the present an archetypal image of    themselves in the past, served as an autobiography of a    people.
26. On the surface these ancestral    Greeks of the Iliad are on the offensive, attacking Troy.    Underneath the surface, they are on the defensive, trying    desperately to ward off the fiery onslaught of Hektor, the leading    Trojan hero. At a climactic point of the battle, Hektor shouts out    to his men:
"Fire now! Bring it       up,              
and all together raise a battle       shout!
that came against the gods' will       to our shore."
With all their ships beached on the    shores of the Hellespont, marked for destruction by the    threatening fire of Hektor, the ancestral Greeks are vulnerable to    nothing short of extinction. The Iliad makes it quite    clear: if their ships burn, the Greeks will never return home, to    become the seafaring nation who are the present audience of the    Iliad. In the Iliad, the very survival of this    seafaring nation is at stake.
27. But what exactly is this Greek    nation? The very idea of nationhood is an incongruity if we apply    it to the era when the Iliad and Odyssey took shape.    From the eighth through the fifth centuries BCE, the geographical    area that we now recognize as ancient Greece was an agglomerate of    territories controlled by scores of independent and competing    city-states. The most important and prestigious of these were    Athens, Sparta, Argos, Thebes, and Corinth. Each city-state, or    polis, was a social entity unto itself, with its own    government, customary laws, religious practices, dialect. The    topic of the city-state brings us to the hidden agenda of the    Odyssey.
28. The fragmentation of Greece in    this era was so pronounced that, looking back, it is hard to find    genuine instances of cultural cohesion. One early example is the    Olympic Games; another is the Oracle of Apollo at Delphi; still    another, and the most obvious, is the poetic legacy of Homer and    Hesiod. The Homeric Iliad and Odyssey    together can be viewed as a marvel of cultural synthesis,    integrating the diverse institutional heritage of this plurality    of city-states, this kaleidoscopic Greek-speaking world, into a    unified statement of cultural identity, of    civilization.
29. The cultural universalism of the    Iliad and Odyssey can best be appreciated    when we consider the extent of the diversity that separated the    Greek city-states from each other. Nowhere is this diversity more    apparent than in the realm of religious practices. How people    worshipped any given god, as we know from the historical evidence    of the Classical era and thereafter, differed dramatically from    one city-state to another. Yet the Iliad and    Odyssey spoke of the gods in a way that united    the varied cultural perceptions and sensitivities of a vast    variety of city-states, large and small. The religious dimensions    of these gods, with Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Athena, and Apollo in    the forefront, were destined to be shaded over by this Homeric    process of synthesis, but their divine reality became highlighted    as a cultural permanence in the same process. The modern reader    may be struck by what seems on the surface to be a distinctly    irreligious attitude of Homeric song towards the gods, but the    universal cultural edifice of these gods' lofty abode on Mount    Olympus was in fact built up from a diversity of unspoken    religious foundations. When Herodotus is saying that Homer and    Hesiod, by way of their songs, had given the Greeks their first    definitive statement about the gods, he is in effect acknowledging    the Olympian synthesis that had been bestowed on civilization by    Homeric and Hesiodic song. It is the history of Greek    civilization, then, that the Homeric Iliad and    Odyssey define.
30. To say that an epic like the    Iliad is about the Greeks and what it is to be a Greek is    not far from saying that the Iliad is about Achilles. We    have seen how this hero, as the very first words of the song make    clear, is the focal point of the Iliad. Given the    importance of the Iliad to the Greeks, we may interpret    this single fact to mean that Achilles is also a focal point of    Greek civilization. Just how important he is, however, can be    illustrated beyond the testimony of Homeric song. Let us take for    example an inherited custom connected with the premier social    event for all Greeks, the Olympic Games. We know from ancient    sources that the traditional ceremony inaugurating this seasonally    recurring pan-Hellenic event centers on Achilles: on an appointed    day when the Games are to begin, the local women of Elis, the    place where the Olympics were held, fix their gaze on the sun as    it sets into the Western horizon - and begin ceremonially to weep    for the hero.
31. The prestige accorded by ancient    Greek civilization to the figure of Achilles, and the strong    emotional attachment that goes with it, is worthy of our attention    especially because modern readers, both men and women, young and    old, often find themselves relatively unresponsive to this sullen    and darkly brooding hero. Few today feel empathy for his sorrow,    which the hero of the Iliad himself describes as an    everlasting one. The modern reader finds it much easier to feel    empathy for Hektor, the champion hero of the Trojans, whose    heartwrenching farewell to his wife and small son, soon to become    his widow and orphan, is often singled out by modern readers as    the most memorable scene of the Iliad. For the ancient    Greeks as well, we may be sure, the figure of Hektor evoked    empathy. The difference, however, is that for them, the pathos of    Hektor resembles most closely the pathos of Achilles himself. Just    as Hektor's death evokes the sorrow of unfulfilled promise, even    more so does the death of Achilles.
32. While Hektor is the idealized    husband and father cut down in his prime, Achilles is the    idealized bridegroom, sensual in his heroic beauty and likewise    doomed to an untimely death. In the songs of Sappho, it is    Achilles who figures as the ultimate bridegroom. The very mention    of him in song conjures up the picture of a beautiful flower cut    down at the peak of its bloom. This is how his own mother sings of    Achilles in Scroll 18 of the Iliad , in a beautiful song of    lament that prefigures the hero's untimely death:
"...how sore my heart is!       Now my life is pain              
for my great son's dark destiny! I       bore
a child flawless and strong beyond       all men.
All the wistful beauty of sorrow for    a life cut short comes back to life in song, and that song of the    hero's mother extends into a song that becomes the Iliad    itself. For the culture of the Greeks was, and still is, a song    culture. For them, to weep is to sing a lament, and the sorrow, in    all its natural reality of physically crying and sobbing, is not    at all incompatible with the art of the song: it flows into    it.
33. If we consider the evocative    power that we can sometimes find in even the simplest contemporary    popular tunes about the sorrows of war and death, we will have at    least something to compare with the emotional and esthetic    response to Achilles in the song culture of the ancient Greek    world. Thinking of Achilles leads to beautiful sad songs. As we    recall the detail about the institutionalized weeping of the local    women at the commencement of the Olympics, we may note that this    act of weeping was considered an act of singing - or keening. In    the words of the fifth-century poet Pindar, the keening of the    Muses, the "Maidens of Helicon," over the dead Achilles extends    into the song of the present:
When he died, the songs did       not leave him, but the Maidens of Helicon stood by his funeral       pyre and his funeral mound, and they poured forth a lament that       is very renowned. And so the gods decided to hand over that       worthy man, dead as he was, to the songs of the       goddesses.              
34a. The sadness of Achilles' song is    of course a necessity of tradition, just as the hero's death, his    mortality, is necessary. The hero, the story of the hero, cannot    be complete if he lives on. For in death the hero wins the    ultimate prize of life eternal in song. As Achilles himself    declares, his heroic death will transcend the fleeting beauty of    earthbound life:
"If ... I remain to       fight              
The Greek word kleos, which    translates here as "glory," conventionally refers to the    glory of song, while aphthiton or "unfading" evokes the    vitality of a blossoming plant. His glory in song, then, unlike    the beauty of a flower, will never fade. And the song of kleos    will remain forever alive in the civilization that sings    Achilles' glorious epic.
34b. For Odysseus, no such choice    needs to be made. His nostos is his kleos.    This kleos too, as proclaimed at the end of the    Odyssey, will be sung for all time.
35a. In Plato's Ion, which    gives us a portrait of a virtuoso performer of Homeric song in the    Classical era, there is a vivid reference to performances of the    Iliad and Odyssey before an audience of more than    20,000 at a seasonally recurring festival at Athens. What is    especially remarkable about this reference is the image of this    audience, all of them, breaking down and weeping as they hear the    saddest moments of the song -or  feeling their hair stand    on end at the most terrifying moments. The performer    describes himself as he gazes down upon a sea of faces in the    audience, all eyes reacting simultaneously to his Homeric song.    Looks from eyes filled with tears alternate with looks of terror    or even sheer wonder as the story of Homeric song oscillates from    one emotion to another:
As I look down at them from       the podium on high, I see them, each and every time, crying or       looking terrified, filled with a sense of wonder at what is       being retold.              
36. Yes, the songs of Achilles and    Odysseus were ever being retold, nurtured by the song culture that    had generated them. But even beyond the song culture, beyond Greek    civilization, the epic lives on even in our time, and the wonder    of it all is that one of its heroes himself foretold    it.
(1) This opening sentence conveys a    distinction between two perspectives: (1) a long-term assessment    from the standpoint of the present and (2) a shorter-term    assessment from the standpoint of a historical cross-section of    the ancient Greek past, focusing on the city-state of Athens    around the second half of the fifth century BCE. I justify the    focus on fifth-century Athens, the Classical setting of "the    ancient Greeks," on the basis of two arguments: (a) that the    ultimate form of the Iliad and Odyssey as we know    them was decisively shaped in Athens during various historical    periods (see my books Homeric Questions [1996]    42-43 and Poetry as Performance [1996] 110-111) and (b)    that one of these periods was the second half of the fifth century    (HQ 75-76 n. 37 and PP 111 nn. 23 and 24). If these    arguments are valid, then the Homeric Iliad and    Odyssey achieved canonical status not only from the    retrospective standpoint of our present but also from the    contemporary standpoint of the Classical period. To this extent, I    can justify my reference to the reception of Homeric poetry by    "the ancient Greeks themselves." I choose as representative of the    Classical period a statement of Herodotus, which is highlighted in    the discussion that follows.
(2) I seek to defamiliarize, from the    start, the English word "hero", drawing it back to the semantics    of Classical Greek hêrôs (plural    hêrôes), as analyzed at HQ 47-48. The    Greek word conveys a religious dimension that is completely absent    in the English word that is derived from it.
(3) I offer here a preliminary    working definition of the hero, without as yet introducing the    dimension of ritual. For the moment, only the dimension of myth is    recognized. I will have more to say later on myth and ritual    together. I adhere to the "genetic" definition of "hero," with    introduction of the symbolism of heroic potential via divine    genes. I work in female as well as male heroes, a principle of    inclusion that becomes much more clear in the dimension of ritual.    
(4) A basic text is Euripides'    Herakles.
(5) The "mock death" of Ares has a    ritual dimension. The Homeric poems are ambivalent about    old-fashioned martial fury. Ares is not god of war per se but of    old-fashioned war, focusing on martial fury.
(6) Here I am thinking primarily of    death in war, but we must not forget the epic theme of death at    sea.

Exchange-traded funds offer a convenient way to invest in sectors or niches that interest you. If you’d like to add some smart grid stocks to your portfolio, but don’t have the time or expertise to hand-pick a few, the First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Smart Grid Infrastructure ETF (NASDAQ: GRID ) could save you a lot of trouble. Instead of trying to figure out which companies will perform best, you can use this ETF to invest in lots of smart grid stocks simultaneously. 
The basics ETFs often sport lower expense ratios than their mutual fund cousins. The First Trust ETF’s expense ratio — its annual fee — is 0.70%, which is a bit more than many ETFs, but still considerably lower than a typical stock mutual fund. The fund is fairly small, too, so if you’re thinking of buying, beware of possibly large spreads between its bid and ask prices. Consider using a limit order if you want to buy in. 
This ETF is too young to have a sufficient track record to assess, but it has underperformedthe world market over the past three years. It’s the future that counts most, though, and, as with most investments, we can’t expect outstanding performances in every quarter or year. Investors with conviction need to wait for their holdings to deliver. Top 10 Diversified Bank Companies To Watch For 2016: M/I Homes Inc. (MHO) 
M/I Homes, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, primarily operates as a builder of single-family homes in the United States.

Joe Raedle/Getty Images U.S. homebuilders’ confidence in the housing market surged this month to the highest level since January, reflecting a pickup in sales of new homes and heightened expectations for sales the second half of the year. The brighter sales outlook suggests home construction could pick up in coming months after a sluggish start this year. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo builder sentiment index released Wednesday rose this month to 53, up four points from a revised reading of 49 in June. Readings above 50 indicate more builders view sales conditions as good, rather than poor. The latest reading is the first above 50 since January, when it was 56. Builders’ view of current sales conditions for single-family homes, their outlook for sales over the next six months and traffic by prospective buyers each increased since June. Higher mortgage rates and the bad weather weighed on home sales in late 2013 and early this year. Harsh winter weather also contributed to a sluggish start to this year’s spring home-selling season. But sales of new homes have picked up in recent months. New home sales jumped 18.6 percent in May to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 504,000, the highest level in six years. That followed a 3.7 percent increase in April. The gains came after declines in February and March. Even with the big overall gain, sales of new homes are still running at just about half the pace of a healthy real estate market. Still, the recent pickup in sales suggests that the housing recovery may be regaining its footing after slowing earlier this year. Economists say there is significant pent-up demand for homes as many potential buyers put off purchases over the past few years because of concerns about the economy. Solid job gains this year also bode well for housing. Employers added 288,000 jobs last month, the fifth straight month of gains above 200,000.

At first glance, POZEN Inc. (NASDAQ:POZN) doesn’t look like anything more than a volatile mover and shaker, currently overbought, and due for a dip. And truth be told, POZN is overbought and due for a pullback (and will be even more so, given this morning’s bullish pre-market activity). When you take a step back and look at the much-bigger-picture though, you’ll find that POZEN Inc. is only at the beginning of what could be a sizeable move for investors willing to give it some time.

Top 10 Diversified Bank Companies To Watch For 2016: Sprott Physical Gold Trust ( PHYS ) 
Sprott Physical Gold Trust (the Trust) is a closed-end mutual fund trust. The Trust was created to invest and hold substantially all of its assets in physical gold bullion. The Trust seeks to provide an exchange-traded investment alternative for investors interested in holding physical gold bullion. The Trust invests primarily in long-term holdings of unencumbered, fully allocated, physical gold bullion and does not speculate with regard to short-term changes in gold prices. Sprott Asset Management LP (the Manager) is the manager and RBC Dexia Investor Services Trust (RBC Dexia), a trust company, is the trustee of the Trust. 
The Trust employs two custodians. The Royal Canadian Mint (Mint) acts as custodian for the Trust’s physical gold bullion, pursuant to a precious metals storage agreement between the Manager, for and on behalf of the Trust, and the Mint, to which it refers as the precious metals storage agreement. RBC Dexia acts as custodian of the Trust’s assets other than physical gold bullion pursuant to the trust agreement. As of December 31, 2010, the Trust held 90% of its total net assets in physical gold bullion in London Good Delivery bar form. The Trust does not invest in gold certificates or other financial instruments that represent gold or that may be exchanged for gold. 
In making investments on behalf of the Trust, the Manager is subject to certain investment and operating restrictions, to which the Trust refers to as the Investment and Operating Restrictions. The Investment and Operating Restrictions provide that the Trust will invest in and hold a minimum of 90% of the total net assets of the Trust in physical gold bullion in London Good Delivery bar form and hold no more than 10% of the total net assets of the Trust, at the discretion of the Manager, in physical gold bullion (in London Good Delivery bar form or otherwise), gold coins, debt obligations of or guaranteed by the Government of Canada o r a province of Canada or by the Government of the United States or a state thereof.

If you are partial to Canadians, or just a little nervous about securing your gold, Sprott Physical Gold Trust (NYSEMKT: PHYS ) is another viable option.

As India and China are the largest buyers of gold, physical demand (PHYS) out of Asia has been moderated in the recent weeks for different reasons. [By Daniel Gibbs] 
Gold trusts and ETFsOne of the easiest ways to profit off of a rising gold price is to buy shares in one of the various exchange-traded gold trusts. These are essentially closed-end funds that own physical gold bullion located in a vault. Each share of the trust represents a fractional ownership share of the physical bullion in the vault. Thus, these trusts could be an easy way to purchase gold exposure directly on an exchange. One example of a trust like this is theSprott Physical Gold Trust (NYSEMKT: PHYS ) .

Canada-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals International is a giant, with a market cap near $44 billion. It’s been in the news more than usual lately after making several bids for Allergan (NYSE: AGN ) , maker of Botox, breast implants, eye drops, and more. Valeant has several Botox alternatives on the market and is interested in owning Botox itself. Allergan’s ophthalmology products can complement Valeant’s own eye-care operations, which became substantial with its $8.7 billion purchase of Bausch & Lomb last year. Some think both companies will benefitfrom the acquisition if it’s ultimately approved, but Allergan isn’t enthused, and it commissioned reportsthat suggest Valeant can’t grow well on its own without resorting to acquisitions. Bulls see plenty of growth potential, though, and they like Valeant’s business model of acquiring products rather than pouring big money into developing treatments on its own that may or may not pan out. Somewhat lost because of the Allergan story is news that Nestlehas bought the U.S. and Canadian rights to Valeant skincare products for $1.4 billion. [By Seth Jayson]

I normally don’t look at charts much, but comparing Orange to its competitors in the French telecommunications market is quite fascinating. As one can see, incumbents Bouygues (BOUYF.PK) and Vivendi (VIVHY.PK) (owner of SFR) saw similar price declines. The market, on the other hand, rapidly bid up the price of new entrant Iliad SA (ILIAF.PK), as a result of forecasts for Iliad to capture significant mobile market share (which it did, around 10%). The wide divergence in price relative to changes in underlying value favor going long the incumbents, including Orange. Because this time it’s different.

Now, while doubling the number of CPU cores in a product already using an ARM CPU would have increased royalty revenue per iPad, a far bigger, and more profitable, coup for ARM would have been a high profile design win, displacing a major competitor. At the iPhone launch event in September, Apple described the iPhone´s A7 chip as "desktop class." This has led to speculation that Apple would be announcing desktops and laptops using ARM where previously it used Intel (INTC) processors. This pipedream did not come to pass either.

Traders should now look for long-biased trades in SPRT as long as it’s trending above its 50-day at $5.51 or above more near-term support at $5.43 and then once it sustains a move or close above Tuesday’s high of $5.92 to its 52-week high at $6.28 with volume that hits near or above 377,189 shares. If that breakout triggers soon, then SPRT will set up to enter new 52-week-high territory above $6.28, which is bullish technical price action. Some possible upside targets off that move are $7 to $8. [By Steve Symington]

PARIS (dpa-AFX) - Der französische Mischkonzern Bouygues hat im ersten Quartal rote Zahlen geschrieben. Operativ habe der Verlust in den ersten drei Monaten 216 Millionen Euro betragen, teilte Bouygues am Mittwoch mit. Analysten hatten jedoch mit einem höheren Minus gerechnet. Während das Baugeschäft auf dem Heimatmarkt sich schwächer entwickelte, liefen die Geschäfte in der Telekomsparte wieder etwas besser. Im Vorjahr hatte das Unternehmen dank positiver Einmaleffekte einen operativen Gewinn von 18 Millionen Euro ausgewiesen. 
Unter dem Strich stand ein Fehlbetrag von 157 Millionen Euro, nach einem Gewinn von 238 Millionen Euro im Vorjahr. Im ersten Quartal 2014 hatten die Franzosen von einem Anteilsverkauf profitiert. Der Umsatz ging um 2 Prozent auf 6,7 Milliarden Euro zurück. Den Ausblick für das Gesamtjahr bestätigte Bouygues. Der operative Gewinn (Ebitda) im Telekomgeschäft soll 2015 stabil bleiben. Das Unternehmen bekommt schon seit längerem den Preiskampf auf Frankreichs Mobilfunkmarkt zu spüren und streicht deshalb unter anderem in dem Bereich Stellen. 
Bouygues sucht weiter nach einer Lösung für die Telekom-Tochter. Im vergangenen Sommer war ein Zusammenschluss der Sparte mit dem Mobilfunk-Platzhirsch Orange gescheitert. Als Interessent gilt der Kabelkonzern Altice. Der französische Mobilfunkmarkt wird seit 2012 durch die Billigmarke Free des Internetkonzerns Iliad aufgewirbelt. In diesem Jahr soll eine Kooperation mit Numericable-SFR bei der Nutzung der Netze gestartet werden. Unter anderem dadurch würden Abschreibungen von rund 200 Millionen Euro anfallen, hieß es./mne/men/fbr

-=-=-TEXT: While the city of Troy grieved, the Achaeans reached the fleet by the Hellespont and dispersed to their own ships, except for the Myrmidons whom Achilles restrained, saying to his warlike friends: ‘Myrmidons, with your swift horses, my loyal comrades, don’t unyoke the teams from their chariots yet, but drive them past Patroclus and mourn for him as the dead should be mourned. Then when we’ve sated ourselves with grief, we’ll un-harness them and eat together here.’
             Then Achilles led them as they raised their voices as one, in lament. Three times, in their grief, they drove their long-maned horses round the corpse, and Thetis intensified their need to weep. The sand and their armour were wet with tears, so great a warrior was the man they mourned. And the son of Peleus was loudest in the strident lament, laying his man-killing hands on his comrade’s breast: ‘Rejoice, Patroclus, even in the House of Hades, for I have kept my promise to you, that I would drag Hector’s corpse here and feed it to the dogs, and I will cut the throats of twelve noble youths of Troy at your pyre, in vengeance for your death.’
            When he had spoken, he thought of a further way to defile Hector’s corpse, flinging it face down in the dust by Patroclus’ bier. The warriors removed their gleaming bronze armour, loosed the war-horses, and sat in their hundreds beside swift-footed Achilles’ ship. He gave them a funeral feast to ease their hearts. Many a sleek ox plunged under the knife, many a sheep and bleating goat was slaughtered, and many a fine fat white-tusked hog was hung above the flames to singe, while blood pooled round the corpse, deep enough to dip the wine-cups in.  
            Now their prince, fleet-footed Achilles, was invited by the Achaean leaders, to dine with King Agamemnon, though he was still grieving deeply and they found him hard at first to persuade. When they all reached Agamemnon’s hut, they told the clear-voiced heralds to set a great cauldron on the fire, in hopes of tempting Achilles to wash the blood from his body. But he refused, and made a vow: ‘By Zeus, the mightiest and best of gods, no water shall come near my head until I have laid Patroclus on the pyre, heaped up his mound, and shorn my hair, for I shall never grieve more deeply while I’m among the living. Let us yield to the necessity for food, however loathsome that prospect, but at dawn, Lord Agamemnon, order wood to be gathered, and provide all that is needed when a dead man enters the deepest darkness, so that Patroclus’ body may be swiftly consumed, and the army return to its toil.’
They readily agreed to his request, and each of them sharing in the meal, they feasted. When their hunger and thirst were sated, they retired to rest. But Achilles lay sighing heavily, among his Myrmidons, by the echoing shore, out in the open just above the breaking surf. His strong limbs were weary from hunting Hector round windy Troy, yet no sooner had sleep seized him, shedding sweetness round him and easing his heart’s cares, than the spirit of poor Patroclus appeared, the very semblance of the man himself, with the same stature, eyes, and clothes, and it was his voice that spoke saying: ‘You sleep, and forget me, Achilles. You neglect me now I’m dead, as you never did when I was alive. Hasten my funeral, and let me pass Hades’ Gate. The spirits keep me out, the shades of men done with toil, who will not let me join them beyond the river, but leave me wandering in vain this side of the yawning Gate. And clasp my hand, I beg you, for once you’ve given me to the fire, I shall not return. You and I will never sit apart from our dear friends and talk as we once did, now that mortal fate has consumed me: that fate appointed for me at my birth. You too, godlike Achilles, are doomed to die beneath the walls of    Troy . One more thing I ask of you, if you will. Don’t bury my ashes far from yours, Achilles. Let them be as one, just as we were when we grew up together. Menoetius brought me, to your house, a child from Opoeis, because I killed Amphidamus’ son, accidentally, in a foolish quarrel over a game. Peleus, the horseman, welcomed me to his palace, showed me loving care, and made me your squire. So let one urn enclose our ashes, the golden urn your royal mother gave you.’
            Fleet-footed Achilles answered: ‘Why, when you are here, dear heart, do you come only to ask such things? I will see to it all, just as you wish, but now come closer, so that, if only for a moment, we might clasp our arms round one another, and sate ourselves with sad lament.’
            So saying, he stretched out his hands in vain. The spirit vanished like smoke beneath the earth, gibbering faintly. Achilles sprang up in turmoil, and beat his hands together, crying sadly: ‘There now! Even in Hades’ House something of us survives, spirit and semblance, but no power of response: for all night long poor Patroclus’ shade, his very likeness, stood over me, weeping, lamenting, saying what I must do.’
Achilles ’ cry woke the Myrmidons to further lament, and rosy-fingered Dawn found them wailing round the pitiful dead. King Agamemnon, meanwhile, sent out men from every hut with mules to fetch wood, under the command of Meriones, attendant on kindly Idomeneus. They carried woodman’s axes and strong ropes, and drove the mules upwards to and fro on winding tracks until they came to the high slopes of Ida, of the many streams. There they set to, the long-bladed axes felling tall oaks with a crash. The Greeks split the logs and roped them to the mules that tore up the ground hauling them through dense undergrowth down to the plain. The woodcutters handled the logs, as Meriones ordered, and stacked them on the shore where Achilles planned a great funeral mound for Patroclus and himself. When they had stacked the wood, the whole crowd sat and waited. Then Achilles gave orders to his warlike Myrmidons to don their armour, and yoke the chariots. They did so and the charioteers mounted their chariots. Then they set off, the chariots first, a host of warriors following on foot, with Patroclus in the midst, carried by his friends. They had cut off locks of their hair and thrown them on the corpse till they covered it like a garment. Noble Achilles walked behind, supporting the head, sorrowing for the peerless comrade he was sending to Hades’ Halls.
            When they reached the place he’d appointed, they set the corpse down on a platform of wood. Now a fresh idea struck Achilles, and stepping back from the pyre he cut a golden lock of his hair, which he had grown to honour the river-god Sperchius. He looked out over the wine-dark sea and spoke anxiously to the god: ‘Sperchius, my father Peleus made vain prayer to you, vowing that if I came home to my native land I’d cut my hair and offer a holy sacrifice of fifty unblemished rams, at the precinct and fragrant altar where your waters flow. The old man made his vow, but you have denied fulfilment. Since I shall not return to my own dear native land, allow me to give this lock of hair to the warrior Patroclus to take with him.’
            So saying, he went and placed the lock of hair in the corpse’s hands, and prompted them all to further displays of grief. Sunset would still have found them weeping, if Achilles had not spoken to Agamemnon: ‘Son of Atreus, the troops obey you above all others, and though they may go on grieving, send them away from the pyre for now, and let them prepare their meal. We the dead man’s closest mourners will manage things here, but ask the leaders to stay.’
            King Agamemnon hearing this, promptly dismissed the men to their well-crafted ships, though the chief mourners remained, and piling up the wood to make the pyre a hundred feet square, sad at heart they placed the corpse on top. They flayed and dressed numerous fine sheep and sleek shambling cattle before the pyre, and noble Achilles took fat from them all and wrapped the corpse in it, head to foot, and piled the flayed carcasses around. Then he leant two-handled jars of oil and honey against the bier, and groaning aloud swiftly threw the bodies of four proud horses on the pyre. Of the nine dogs Patroclus fed beneath his table, Achilles cut the throats of two and threw their bodies on the pyre. Then he completed the grim task he had in mind, killing twelve noble sons of the brave Trojans with his bronze blade, and setting the pyre alight so the pitiless flames would spread. Then he gave a groan, and called his dear friend by name: ‘All hail to you, Patroclus, though in the House of Hades. See how I keep the promises I made. Twelve noble sons of brave Trojans, the fire will devour with you. But the dogs, not the flames, shall feed on Hector, son of Priam.’
            Yet, despite his threats, no dogs defiled Hector’s corpse, for Aphrodite, Zeus’ daughter, kept them from him, night and day, and anointed him with sweet ambrosial oil of roses, so Achilles would not tear the flesh dragging the corpse about. And Phoebus Apollo drew a dark cloud down from sky to earth, and cloaked the whole place where the dead man lay, to prevent the sun shrivelling the flesh and sinews of his limbs.  
Now the pyre of dead Patroclus would not burn. Fleet-footed Achilles took thought, then standing back from the pyre prayed to the winds, Boreas the North-wind, Zephyrus the West, promising them fine offerings. Pouring libations from a golden cup, he begged them fervently to blow, so the wood might kindle and the bodies might burn. Iris heard his prayer, and flew swiftly to give the Winds his message. They were feasting together in Zephyrus’ house, Lord of the Western Gales, when Iris halted on his stone threshold. They sprang up when they saw her, and called her to sit beside them. But she refused, saying: ‘I can’t, I must return to Ocean’s stream, and the land of the Ethiopians, where they are sacrificing to the immortals, and share in their sacred feast. But Achilles asks for you Boreas, and you wild Zephyr, and promises fine offerings if you’ll kindle the pyre where Patroclus lies, for whom the Achaeans grieve.’
            Then she left while the winds rose with a roar, driving the clouds in rout before them. Soon they were out at sea, stirring the swelling waves with their stormy blast. Reaching the fertile   land  of  Troy , they attacked the pyre, raising a great column of roaring fire. As one, their blast beat on the flames, howling all night long, and all night long swift Achilles drew wine from a golden bowl in a two-handled cup, and poured it on the ground, wetting the earth and calling to the spirit of poor Patroclus. And Achilles, pacing heavily round the fire, groaned without cease, while his friend’s bones burned, as a father groans for a newly-wedded son whose death leaves his wretched parents in despair.  
            At the hour when the Morning Star rises, heralding the new day, and in his wake saffron-robed Dawn spreads light on the waves, the fire died down and the flames ceased. The Winds returned home over the Thracian    Sea , roaring above the surging waves. Achilles turned away from the smouldering pyre, lay down exhausted, and instantly slept. But his comrades gathered round him, and the noise of their voices and footsteps roused him once more. Sitting upright, he spoke to them: ‘Atreides, and you other leaders of the Achaeans, quench the glowing pyre with red wine, wherever there are embers, then let us collect the ashes of Patroclus, Menoetius’ son, separating them from the rest, though that is easy since he lay at the centre of the pyre, while the men and horses and the rest were burned at its edge. Then we will place the ashes in a golden urn, sealed with a double layer of fat, until such time as I too vanish to Hades. As for the mound, provide what is fitting but no more, and whichever of you survive among the benched ships when I am gone, then you must build our joint mound broad and high.’
            They did as fleet-footed Achilles requested, first quenching the fire with wine to its edge, where there were embers; then, in tears, collecting the white ashes of their gentle comrade, placing them in a golden urn sealed with a double layer of fat, and covering it with a soft linen cloth they took it to his hut. Next they traced the circuit of his mound, setting a ring of stones around the pyre then piling earth inside. When they had raised the barrow, they made as if to leave, but Achilles stopped them and made them sit in a wide ring where he had decided funeral games would be held, and sent for prizes from his ships; cauldrons, tripods, horses, mules, sturdy oxen, female slaves and grey iron.    
For the first event, a chariot race, Achilles offered splendid prizes; a woman skilled in fine handiwork, and a tripod with ear-shaped handles holding twenty-two measures, for the winner; a six-year old mare, broken-in and pregnant with a mule foal, for the runner-up; for the third place, a brand new gleaming cauldron holding four measures; for the fourth, two talents of gold; and the fifth a brand new two-handled cooking dish.  
            He rose and spoke to the Argives: ‘Atreides, and you other bronze-greaved Achaeans, these are the prizes that await the winning charioteers. If we Greeks were holding the games in another man’s honour, since I have the finest pair of horses, immortal steeds that Poseidon gave my father Peleus, and he in turn gave me, no doubt I would carry off first prize, but they’ve lost their great and glorious charioteer, a kind man who’d rub sweet oil in their manes after washing them in clear water. And now they stand and mourn him, heart-stricken, their manes sweeping the ground. But the event is open to the rest of you, whichever of you Achaeans trust in your horses and chariot.’
            At this the competitors came forward. Noble Eumelus was first to rise, Admetus’ dear son, a skilful horseman. Then Mighty Diomedes, son of Tydeus, rose to harness the horses, of the breed of Tros, taken from Aeneas though Apollo saved Aeneas himself. Red-haired Menelaus was next, Zeus-born Atreides, yoking swift horses, Aethe, a mare of Agamemnon’s, and his own horse Podargus. Echepolus, Anchises of Sicyon’s son, had given the mare as a gift to Agamemnon, so he might stay safely at home and not follow the king to windy    Troy . Zeus had granted him great wealth in spacious  Sicyon . Menelaus now harnessed the eager mare.  The fourth to ready his long-maned team was Antilochus, noble son of proud Nestor, son of Neleus, and the swift horses harnessed to his chariot were of the Pylian breed. His father approached to offer some good advice, the wise to the wise: ‘Antilochus, young as you are, Zeus and Poseidon love you, and they have made you an expert horseman, so you need little advice from me. Yet, expert though you are at navigating the turns, remember your horses are the slowest in this race, and that’s a great handicap. Their horses are quicker, but their charioteers no more cunning, so use all your skill, if you don’t want to see the prizes slip away. It is skill not mere strength that makes the better woodsman; skill lets the helmsman on the wine-dark wave steer a sailing ship, buffeted by the wind; and skill too sees one charioteer beat another. One man, leaving it all to his horses, slackens the reins and lets his team wander, his line stray, but the skilful man, though with slower horses, thinks of the turn and wheels close by the post, keeps his team in hand from the start, uses the ox-hide reins, and keeps his eyes on the lead chariot.  
            Now here’s something to look out for. There’s a dead-tree stump, of weathered oak or pine, about six foot high, flanked by two white stones, at the turn. The ground is smooth and firm on the bend. It may mark an ancient grave, or perhaps was a turning post long ago. Now Achilles has adopted it as his. Hug it tightly as you turn, and lean to the left of your team yourself as you stand firm on your platform of plaited thongs. Flick the offside horse with your whip, shout him on and give him rein, but let the near-side run so near the post the hub of the well-built wheel almost grazes the stone, but don’t touch it and wreck your chariot and harm the horses, or the rest will have glory and you the blame. Use your wits, dear son, and look sharp. If you can pass inside at the turn, no one will put on speed and overtake you, not even if he drove noble Arion, in pursuit, Adrastus’ racehorse that was sired in heaven or of Laomedon’s breed of famous horses, the very best in    Troy .’
            With this advice to his son on how to win, Nestor, son of Neleus, regained his place and sat, while Meriones, the fifth competitor, readied his long-maned horses. Then all mounted their chariots, and cast their lots one by one into Achilles’ helmet. When he shook it, out leapt the lot of Nestor’s son Antilochus; then that of Lord Eumelus; of Menelaus the famous spearman; and of Meriones; while that of Diomedes, the best of them all, was last. They lined up for the start, and Achilles pointed out the turning post for off over the flat plain, where godlike Phoenix, his father’s squire, was placed as referee, to keep a watch on the race and judge their merits.  
As one, they raised their whips, shook the reins, and urged their teams on. Swiftly the horses galloped over the plain, leaving the ships behind. A whirlwind cloud of dust rose to their chests, and their manes streamed in the wind. Now the chariots ran freely over the solid ground, now they leapt in the air, while the hearts of the charioteers beat fast as they strove for victory, and they shouted to their horses, flying along in the storm of dust.  
            It was not till the galloping horses were heading back towards the grey sea that each team showed its mettle, and the charioteers forced the pace. Eumelus’ swift-footed mares shot to the front, chased by Diomedes’ stallions, hot on their heels, as if they might   mount   Eumelus ’ chariot, and their heads were at his back as they flew, blowing hot breath on his neck and shoulders. Diomedes would have passed him now, or at least drawn level, if Phoebus Apollo in resentment had not struck the gleaming whip from his hand. Diomedes saw the mares run on, while his own horses slowed without the effect of the whip, and tears of anger filled his eyes. But Athene saw that Apollo had interfered, and speeding after, returned the whip and inspired the team. Then in her anger she chased down Eumelus, and shattered the yoke of his chariot, so the mares swerved from side to side and the broken pole struck the ground, while Eumelus himself was hurled to the earth beside the wheel. The skin was stripped from his elbows, nose and cheeks, his forehead bruised, while his eyes filled with tears and he was robbed of speech.  
            Meanwhile Diomedes passed the wreck and drove his powerful horses on, far in the lead. Athene had strengthened his team and given him the glory. And red-haired Menelaus, the son of Atreus, ran second. But Antilochus called to his father’s team: ‘On now, show me how you can run. You’ll not catch Diomedes’ pair, for Athene grants them strength and him the glory. But chase down Menelaus’ team, don’t let them beat you, or Aethe the mare will put you to shame. Why so slow, my beauties? I’ll tell you this, if we win a lesser prize, there’ll be no sweet fodder at Nestor’s hands, he’ll slit your throats with his keen blade. So on, as fast as you can, and I’ll contrive to pass them where the course narrows: that’s my chance.’
            With this the horses, responding to his threat, speeded up for a while, and soon the steadfast Antilochus saw a narrow place in the sunken road ahead, where a stream swollen by winter rain had eroded the track and hollowed out the course. Menelaus drove on assuming no one could overtake, but Antilochus veered alongside, almost off the track. Then Menelaus called to him, in alarm: ‘Rein in Antilochus, that’s recklessness! The track’s wider further on. Pass there if you can, mind my chariot, don’t wreck us both!’
             He shouted loud enough, but Antilochus, pretending not to hear, plied his whip and drove the more wildly. They ran side by side a discus length, as far as a young athlete testing his strength can hurl it from the shoulder, then Menelaus held back, and his pair gave way, fearing the teams might collide and overturn the light chariots, hurling their masters in the dust, for all their eagerness to win. Red-haired Menelaus stormed at Antilochus: ‘You’re a pest Antilochus, we Achaeans credited you with more sense. All the same, you’ll not win a prize, when I force you to answer on oath to this.’  
            With that he addressed his team: ‘Don’t flag, and don’t lose heart. Their legs will weaken sooner than yours, they’re carrying more years.’ And his pair, responding to his call, increased their speed and closed on the pair in front.  
Meanwhile the spectators, from their seats in the ring, were waiting to catch sight of the horses, flying towards them in a cloud of dust. The Cretan leader, Idomeneus, was first to see them, from the lookout point high above the assembly. When he heard the charioteer’s voice shouting to his horses, he recognised the man despite the distance; and he knew one of the lead horses that showed clearly, a bay with a white patch like a full moon on its brow. He stood and called to the Argives: ‘My friends, can you see the horses too? A different team’s ahead, it’s a new charioteer in the lead. Eumelus’ mares were in front on the outward leg, but they must have come to grief. I saw them galloping first towards the turning post, but there’s no sign of them now, though I’ve searched the whole Trojan plain. Perhaps the reins slipped from his hands, and he failed to take the turn? I think it’s there his chariot must have wrecked, and hurled him to the ground, while the mares swerved and bolted in their terror. Stand and look on, yourselves. I think the leader is Aetolian, yes, it’s great Diomedes, prince among Argives, son of horse-taming Tydeus.’
            But Ajax the Lesser, that fine runner, the son of Oïleus, was quick to disagree: ‘Idomeneus, why are you always sounding off? Those high-stepping mares are still far out on the plain. Your not young any more, nor are your eyes the sharpest among us, yet you’re always laying down the law. Among your betters you should hold your tongue. Eumelus’ mares are still in the lead, just as they were before, that’s him standing there, the reins in his hands.’
            Idomeneus answered angrily: ‘ Ajax , you’re good at insults, but useless in council, your bad manners always let you down. Come, let’s bet on whose in the lead, with Atreides as referee. Let’s wager a tripod or a cauldron, losing it might teach you a lesson.’
            At this,   Ajax  the Lesser, in his anger, leapt to his feet ready with more insults, and the quarrel would soon have been out of hand, if Achilles had not risen and spoken: ‘ Ajax , Idomeneus, no more of this, enough of these crude discourtesies! It is wrong to behave so, and you’d be the first to condemn such things in others. Sit down again, in the ring, and watch the race. The teams will soon be home in their rush for victory, and then you’ll all see which of the Argive horses lead, and which are behind.’
Diomedes  soon arrived, whipping the high-stepping horses hard, as they sped towards the goal. Showers of dust clung to him, and the wheel rims hardly left a trace on the powdery ground, as the swift-footed pair flew onwards pulling the chariot, decorated with gold and tin. He drew to a halt in the centre of the ring, sweat pouring to the ground from his horses’ chests and necks. He himself leapt to the ground from his gleaming chariot, and leant the long whip against the shaft. Nor did his squire Sthenelus lose a moment in claiming the prize, but eagerly his joyful friends led away the women and carried off the eared tripod, while he un-harnessed the horses.  
            Antilochus, Nestor’s son, came in second, having outstripped Menelaus by guile not speed, though Menelaus and his swift team still came in close behind, by no more than the distance from horse to wheel. As a horse strains at the yoke under its master’s lash, the tip of its tail brushes the wheel rim, and that was how close Menelaus came to peerless Antilochus, though he had been a discus throw behind at first. Long-maned Aethe, Agamemnon’s mare, was pulling ever more strongly, and if the course had been a little longer, he would have overtaken Antilochus decisively.  
            Meriones, Idomeneus’ strong squire, came in a spear-cast behind Menelaus, being the least skilful charioteer and driving the slowest horses. And last of all came Eumelus, dragging his light chariot and driving his horses ahead of him. Hearing his tale, swift-footed Achilles felt sorry for the man, and spoke winged words to the Argives: ‘The best charioteer has come in last, but he deserves the prize for second place, given Diomedes has won the first.’
            The Achaeans shouted their agreement, and he would have given Eumelus the mare, if Antilochus, son of proud Nestor, had not risen to object: ‘Achilles, if you as you say, then I resent it. Good man though he is, you’d rob me of my prize, just because he and his chariot came to harm. He’d not have been last, if he’d prayed to the gods before the race. If you truly pity him, and he’s dear to you, then in your hut there’s a pile of gold and bronze, there are women, horses, sheep too. Give him a fine prize later, or do it now and have these Greeks applaud you. But I’ll not yield the mare, if anyone wants her let him fight me for her, hand to hand.’
            Noble Achilles, the great runner, smiled at Antilochus, his dear comrade, and rejoicing in his friendship, spoke to him warmly: ‘Antilochus, if you’d rather I gave Eumelus something of my own, as an extra prize, I will. I’ll grant him the breastplate I took from Asteropaeus. It’s a valuable one, of bronze plated with bands of shining tin.’
            Then he asked his dear friend Automedon to fetch it from his hut, and taking it he placed it in Eumelus’ hands, and he was delighted to receive it.
Now Menelaus rose, mortified and furiously angry with Antilochus. A herald placed the staff in his hands and commanded silence then the godlike warrior spoke: ‘Antilochus, what is this? You used to be a man of sense. Now you shame my prowess, cutting across my team and thrusting your own slower pair ahead. Come now, leaders and rulers of Achaea, judge impartially between us, lest in future some bronze-clad Achaean says that Antilochus, who cheated Menelaus, won the mare because though his team were not as fast, he was the worthier and more skilful man. I will even resolve the case myself and justly too, such that none of you Danaans will disagree. Antilochus, nurtured by Zeus, come here. Stand before your chariot and team, and as is customary take the whip in hand you used just now, place your hand against a horse’s flank and swear by the Earth-Shaker and Encircler that you did not thwart me by a deliberate foul.’
            ‘Ah, be gentle with me, King Menelaus,’ the sober Antilochus replied, ‘you are older and wiser. You know the follies a young man commits, his mind is hasty, and his judgement poor. So forgive me, and I will give you the mare myself, of my own free will. And if you ask more of me and my house, I’d give it eagerly, rather than be exiled from your heart, you whom Zeus nurtured, and perjure myself before the gods.’
            With this, proud Nestor’s son led the mare forward, and gave her up to Menelaus, whose heart was warmed by the gesture, warmed like the dew-wet grain ripening at harvest time. So he spoke warm words, to Antilochus, in reply: ‘Antilochus, I can’t be angry with you, since you were never foolish or reckless before, though this time youth got the better of judgement. Don’t try to outwit your elders. It would have been harder for another to placate me, but you and your good father and your brother have toiled and suffered greatly for my cause, so I accept your apology and grant you the mare though she is mine, so all may know my heart is never over-proud or unyielding.’
            So saying, he handed the mare over to Noëmon, Antilochus’ friend, to lead away, and took the gleaming cauldron as his prize. Meriones who had come in fourth, accepted the two talents of gold so reserved, while the fifth prize, the two-handled dish went unclaimed. Achilles carried it through the throng, and approaching Nestor handed it to him, saying: ‘My venerable lord, accept and treasure this memento of Patroclus’ funeral, for you will never see him more among the Argives. Sadly, old age weighs on you now, and you cannot contend in boxing, wrestling, javelin throwing or the foot-race, but I give you this prize nonetheless.’
            So saying, he placed it in Nestor’s hands, and he accepting it with delight, replied with winged words: ‘Yes, indeed, my son, what you say is true. I am no longer as steady on my feet, dear friend, nor can I fling my arms out in a wide wrestling grip. I wish I were as young and strong as that time when the Epeians were interring King Amarynceus at Buprasium, and his sons held funeral games in his honour. Then no man proved himself my equal, Epians, Pylians or proud Aetolians. I beat Clytomedes, the son of Enops, in the boxing and Ancaeus of Pleuron, who took me on in the wrestling. In the foot race I outran Iphiclus, good as he was, and my spear out-threw Phyleus and Polydorus. Only in the chariot race did the two Moliones beat me, by their combined superior strength, forcing their team to the front, begrudging me the victory since the race carried the best prize. They were twins, and one could drive with a sure hand, while the other plied the whip.  
            Such was the man I once was, but now it’s time for younger men. Sadly old age is upon me, though then I was first among the warriors. Now you must go on with your dear friend’s funeral games. Meanwhile I welcome your gift with pleasure, your remembrance of our friendship delights my heart, and of the honour I’m owed among the Achaeans. In return, let the gods grant you favour enough to satisfy your heart.’
When he had listened to Nestor’s words, Achilles, son of Peleus, made his way through the crowd of spectators and set out the prizes for the boxing-match. For the winner he fetched a six-year old mule, broken-in, and they are hardest of all to break, and tethered it in the arena. For the loser there was a two-handled drinking cup. Then he announced the contest: ‘Atreides, and all you bronze-greaved Achaeans, I want to see our two best boxers raise their fists and fight for these prizes. He whom Apollo grants true endurance in our eyes will return to his hut leading this sturdy mule, while the loser shall have this fine cup.’
            At this a tall and powerful warrior stood up, a champion boxer, Epeius, son of Panopeus. He placed his hand on the mule, saying: ‘Whoever wants the cup, step forward. No man will beat me with his fists, and take the mule, since I’m the best boxer, I say. I may not be the greatest warrior, a man can’t be best at everything, but this thing is for sure, whoever I fight I’ll tear his flesh to ribbons and break his bones. I hope his kin are here to take him away when I’ve felled him.’
            A silence fell at his words. Godlike Euryalus alone stood up to fight him, the son of King Mecisteus, Talaus’ son, who at the funeral games for Oedipus, in Thebes, defeated every Cadmeian opponent. Diomedes, the spearman, eager to see him win, helped Euryalus to prepare, and gave him encouragement. He buckled on his belt, and bound the ox-hide thongs carefully on his hands. When the two contestants were ready, they stepped to the centre of the arena, and raising their mighty arms, set to. Each landed heavy blows with their fists, and they ground their teeth, as the sweat poured over their limbs. Euryalus sought an opening, but noble Epeius swung and struck his jaw, and he went straight down, his legs collapsing under him. Like a fish that leaps in the weed-strewn shallows, under a ripple stirred by the North Wind, then falls back into the dark wave, so Euryalus leapt when he was struck, but the big-hearted Epeius, lifted him and set him on his feet, and all his friends crowded round, and supported him from the ring his feet trailing, his head lolling, as he spat out clots of blood. He was still confused when they sat him down in his corner, and had to fetch the cup, his prize, themselves.  
Swiftly, Achilles brought out the prizes for the third contest, a wrestling bout. For the winner, a great tripod to hold a cauldron over the flames, valued by the Achaeans at twelve oxen; for the loser a female slave skilled in fine handiwork, and she they reckoned at four oxen. Then he announced the bout: ‘Rise now, whichever pair of warriors will try their skill.’ At his words, Telamonian Ajax stepped forward, and cunning Odysseus also got to his feet, a man of many wiles. When they had both prepared, they entered the ring, and came to grips, clasping each other in their mighty arms, locked together like the sloping rafters that some skilled craftsman sets in place on a tall house, to resist the winds. Their backs creaked under the pressure of their strong hands, and the sweat ran down in streams, while many a blood-red weal appeared on their shoulders and ribs, as they strove for the ornate tripod and the glory. Odysseus could no more trip   Ajax , and floor him, than  Ajax  could move powerful Odysseus’ firm stance. But when they began to weary the watching Achaeans,  Ajax  spoke quietly to Odysseus: ‘Zeus-born son of Laertes, Odysseus of the many wiles, you’d best try lift me, or I you, and let Zeus decide the matter.’
            So saying, he tried a lift, but Odysseus knew a trick or two. He kicked   Ajax  hard in the back of his knee, and toppled him backwards, falling on his chest. The spectators looked on admiringly, as they stood and noble long-enduring Odysseus in turn tried a lift, raising him off the ground a fraction, then failing to lift him further crooking a leg round  Ajax ’s knee, so they fell side by side, smothered in dust. They sprang up ready for a third round, but Achilles restrained them: ‘No more, don’t wear each other out. You were both victorious, and shall have identical prizes: there are other events now for competition.’ With this, they readily retired, and wiping the dust from their bodies, donned their tunics.
Now Achilles offered prizes for a foot-race. First prize was a fine silver mixing bowl, of six measures, the loveliest thing in the world, a masterpiece of Sidonian craftsmanship, gifted to Thoas by Phoenician merchants on a trading mission over the dark waters. His grandson Euneos, Jason’s son, gave it to Patroclus as ransom for Lycaon. Now Achilles offered the bowl as a prize to the fastest runner, in tribute to his friend. The second prize was a large well-fattened ox, and for the third a half talent in gold. Achilles now rose and asked for entrants. Swift Ajax the Lesser, and Odysseus, the cunning, stepped forward, with the fastest of the young men, Antilochus, Nestor’s son. They took their places at the start, and Achilles pointed out the turning post. Off they ran, and   Ajax , son of Oïleus, hit the front, with noble Odysseus at his heels, as close as a woman weaving holds the shuttle to her chest, as she draws it along skilfully passing its spool through the warp. He trod in  Ajax ’s footsteps before the dust had settled, and his breath beat on  Ajax ’s neck as they ran swiftly on. The Greeks shouted for Odysseus as he strained for victory, urging him on to the utmost. As they were nearing the finish, Odysseus prayed urgently in his heart to bright-eyed Athene: ‘Goddess, hear me, help me if you will and quicken my legs.’ He prayed and Athene heard, making his limbs seem lighter, and just as they reached the line, Pallas Athene made  Ajax  slip on a patch of offal from the sacrifice of bellowing bulls that fleet-footed Achilles had made in honour of Patroclus. He fell and his mouth and nostrils were filled with offal, while Odysseus came in first, and claimed the silver bowl, leaving the ox for noble  Ajax . He stood there, spitting out the offal, grasping the ox’s horn, and complained to the Argives: ‘There, did you see how the goddess made me slip, she who’s always at Odysseus side, helping him!’
            His words raised a shout of laughter. Antilochus lifted his prize, the gold, and addressed the crowd: ‘Friends, I declare, and don’t we know it, the immortals love the older generation. Ajax has only a few years more than I, but Odysseus is of the breed of former times, and as men say, a green old age is his, and he’s a hard man for any Greek to beat, except for Achilles.’
            This tribute to swift-footed Achilles brought a response from the prince himself: ‘Antilochus, your praise shall not go unrewarded; and I’ll double the value of your prize. So saying he placed another half-talent in his hands, much to Antilochus’ delight.
Now Achilles brought out a shield and helmet, and a long-shadowed spear, Sarpedon’s gear that Patroclus had captured. Then he announced the next event: ‘Our two best warriors must arm, and fight each other for these prizes before the army, with naked bronze. I will give the one who first penetrates the other’s guard and draws blood, this noble silver-studded Thracian sword I took from Asteropaeus, and the other arms they both can share, as well as a fine banquet in my hut.’
            At these words, great Telamonian Ajax and mighty Diomedes, Tydeus’ son, leapt to their feet. When they had armed themselves on their own side of the ring, they advanced to the centre, so menacing and eager for battle the Achaeans held their breath. Closing, they charged three times and each time thrust at each other with their spears.   Ajax  pierced Diomedes’ shield, but his breastplate kept the point from wounding him, while Diomedes kept thrusting at the rim of  Ajax ’s shield, aiming for his neck with the point of his gleaming lance. Now the Greeks were so fearful for  Ajax  that they called an end to the contest and for shared prizes. However, Achilles awarded the long-sword to Diomedes, with its scabbard and its fine belt.  
Then Achilles offered as prize a huge lump of pig-iron that the powerful Eëtion used to hurl. Achilles had carried it off, aboard ship, with other of his possessions, after he had killed him. Now he announced the next competition, calling for entrants: ‘The winner of this will have iron enough for five years, and even if his farmland is remote, he won’t need to send a ploughman or a shepherd into town for lack of it, this will supply all his needs.’
            Up leapt steadfast Polypoetes; godlike and powerful Leonteus; Telamonian Ajax, and noble Epeius. They lined up, and first Epeius grasped the mass of iron and hurled it, but the Achaeans mocked his feeble effort. Then Leonteus, offshoot of Ares, tried and his mark was quickly passed by   Ajax , whose mighty throw won him the lead. But when stalwart Polypoetes, grasped and flung it, he sent it far beyond them all, like a herdsman hurling his crook and sending it whirling past his herd of cows. There was a great shout, and Polypoetes’ friends ran to carry off the royal prize to the hollow ships.    
For the archery prizes, Achilles laid out ten double-headed axes of dark iron and ten single. He set up a mast from a blue-prowed ship a long way off on the sands, and fastened a pigeon to it by the foot, offering the fluttering bird as a target: ‘Whoever hits the pigeon as it flutters, wins the double-headed axes for himself, and if anyone strikes the cord that holds it, but misses the bird, he shall take the prize for a lesser shot, the single-headed axes.’
            At this Lord Teucer rose, as did Meriones, noble squire to Idomeneus. They shook lots in a bronze helmet, and Teucer took first shot. He swiftly let fly a mighty arrow, but forgot his intended promise to Apollo of a rich sacrifice of firstling lambs. Apollo grudging him success, caused him to miss the bird, but hit the cord that tied its foot, the sharp arrow slicing the bond in two. The cord fell, as the pigeon darted skyward, and the Achaeans raised a great shout. But Meriones, who had readied an arrow while Teucer aimed, snatched the bow from Teucer’s hand, vowing instantly to offer those lambs to the Archer God. High up against the clouds he saw the pigeon fluttering, and as she circled he sent an arrow clean through her wing, the shaft falling to earth again and sticking upright in the ground at Meriones’ feet. Meanwhile the pigeon settled on the mast, her head drooping and her plumage all awry. There she quickly died, and fell from her perch, as the spectators gazed in wonder. So Meriones carried off the ten double-axes, while Teucer took the rest to the hollow ships.  
Finally, the son of Peleus, brought a long-shadowed spear, and a new cauldron as yet unused, embossed with flowers, and worth an ox. He set them down and the javelin throwers rose, imperial Agamemnon, son of Atreus, and Meriones, squire to Idomeneus, who was eager to compete again. But fleet-footed Achilles addressed the king: ‘Atreides, we know how excellent you are at the javelin, our superior in strength and skill; so take the cauldron to the hollow ships, and I suggest we grant the spear to Meriones, if that is agreeable to you.’  
            Agamemnon, king of men, agreed to this, and Achilles gave the bronze spear to Meriones, and handed the king’s fine prize to Talthybius the royal herald.

-=-=-TEXT: Sing, goddess, the anger of Peleus son Achilleus
 and its devastation, which put pains thousandfold upon the Achaians,
 hurled in their multitudes to the house of Hades strong souls
 of heroes, but gave their bodies to be the delicate feasting
 of dogs, of all birds, and the will of Zeus was accomplished
 since that time when first there stood in division of conflict
 Atreus son the lord of men and brilliant Achilleus. . . .
Translated by Richmond Lattimore (1951)
 Anger be now your song, immortal one,
 Akhilleus anger, doomed and ruinous,
 that caused the Akhaians loss on bitter loss
 and crowded brave souls into the undergloom,
 leaving so many dead men  carrion
 for dogs and birds; and the will of Zeus was done.
 Begin it when the two men first contending
 broke with one another 
 Agamémnon, Atreus son, and Prince Akhilleus. . . .
Translated by Robert Fitzgerald (1974)
 Rage  Goddess, sing the rage of Peleus son Achilles,
 murderous, doomed, that cost the Achaeans countless losses,
 hurling down to the House of Death so many sturdy souls,
 great fighters souls, but made their bodies carrion,
 feasts for the dogs and birds,
 and the will of Zeus was moving toward its end.
 Begin, Muse, when the two first broke and clashed,
 Agamemnon lord of men and brilliant Achilles. . . .
Translated by Robert Fagles (1990)
Sing in me, Muse, and through me tell the story
 of that man skilled in all ways of contending,
 the wanderer, harried for years on end,
 after he plundered the stronghold
 on the proud height of Troy.
                                                He saw the townlands
 and learned the minds of many distant men,
 and weathered many bitter nights and days
 in his deep heart at sea, while he fought only
 to save his life, to bring his shipmates home.
 But not by will nor valor could he save them,
 for their own recklessness destroyed them all 
 children and fools, they killed and feasted on
 the cattle of Lord Hêlios, the Sun,
 and he who moves all day through the heaven
 took from their eyes the dawn of their return. . . .
Translated by Robert Fitzgerald (1961)
 Tell me, Muse, of the man of many ways, who was driven
 far journeys, after he had sacked Troys sacred citadel.
 Many were they whose cities he saw, whose minds he learned of,
 many the pains he suffered in his spirit on the wide sea,
 struggling for his own life and the homecoming of his companions.
 Even so he could not save his companions, hard though
 he strove to; they were destroyed by their own wild recklessness,
 fools, who devoured the oxen of Helios, the Sun God,
 and he took away the day of their homecoming. . . .
Translated by Richmond Lattimore (1965)
 Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns
 driven time and again off course, once he had plundered
 the hallowed heights of Troy.
 Many cities of men he saw and learned their minds,
 many pains he suffered, heartsick on the open sea,
 fighting to save his life and bring his comrades home.
 But he could not save them from disaster, hard as he strove 
 the recklessness of their own ways destroyed them all,
 the blind fools, they devoured the cattle of the Sun
 and the Sungod blotted out the day of their return. . . .

PARIS (dpa-AFX) - Der französische Mischkonzern Bouygues hat im ersten Quartal rote Zahlen geschrieben. Operativ habe der Verlust in den ersten drei Monaten 216 Millionen Euro betragen, teilte Bouygues am Mittwoch mit. Analysten hatten jedoch mit einem höheren Minus gerechnet. Während das Baugeschäft auf dem Heimatmarkt sich schwächer entwickelte, liefen die Geschäfte in der Telekomsparte wieder etwas besser. Im Vorjahr hatte das Unternehmen dank positiver Einmaleffekte einen operativen Gewinn von 18 Millionen Euro ausgewiesen. 
Unter dem Strich stand ein Fehlbetrag von 157 Millionen Euro, nach einem Gewinn von 238 Millionen Euro im Vorjahr. Im ersten Quartal 2014 hatten die Franzosen von einem Anteilsverkauf profitiert. Der Umsatz ging um 2 Prozent auf 6,7 Milliarden Euro zurück. Den Ausblick für das Gesamtjahr bestätigte Bouygues. Der operative Gewinn (Ebitda) im Telekomgeschäft soll 2015 stabil bleiben. Das Unternehmen bekommt schon seit längerem den Preiskampf auf Frankreichs Mobilfunkmarkt zu spüren und streicht deshalb unter anderem in dem Bereich Stellen. 
Bouygues sucht weiter nach einer Lösung für die Telekom -Tochter. Im vergangenen Sommer war ein Zusammenschluss der Sparte mit dem Mobilfunk-Platzhirsch Orange gescheitert.

-=-=-TEXT: As the audience streamed into the lobby of the Spencer Theatre a few minutes after the opening night performance of Kansas City Repertory Theatre’s intense production of “An Iliad,” I bumped into a well-known veteran actor who said he was stunned by what he had just seen. 
“Stunned” is probably the best description for the expression on his face. We quickly agreed that neither of us had ever seen anything quite like it. 
The play, written for one actor by Denis O’Hare and Lisa Peterson, is an imaginative approach to Homer’s “The Iliad.” The piece brings key episodes of the epic poem to life through the voice of the Poet, a sort of itinerant storyteller who transcends time and space and uses the material as a lens through which we see the horror and heartbreak of all wars, from prehistory to this very moment. 
The Poet is played by Kyle Hatley, who delivers a performance unique in its balance of physicality, vocal delivery, emotional intensity and smarts. Anyone familiar with his work knows that Hatley is a skilled actor capable of rising above the material he’s given. In this case the transcendent material is the play itself, which Hatley inhabits and makes his own.
The Rep production, directed by Jerry Genochio, is impeccably realized in visual terms.
Scenic designer Martin Andrew’s set is an eye-popping achievement that appears to be constructed of salvaged wood and provides a sprawling playing area with what appears to be the curved, skeletal remains of ancient ships washed up at the foot of a crumbling battlement. It is at once rough-hewn and elegant and lends the production a dreamlike, timeless feel. 
Georgianna Londre Buchanan’s costumes — simple, rustic and thoughtfully detailed — complement the set, and Grant Wilcoxen’s lighting manages the neat trick of being both understated and spectacular. 
But without a vivid central performance, the design elements would be meaningless. The show runs only 100 minutes, more or less, but Hatley invites us on an epic journey that leaves no doubt among viewers that they’ve traveled to a place they’ve never encountered before.
Hatley finds opportunities for humor, sometimes dry, sometimes raucous. His impersonation of a drunken, petty Menelaus debating an enraged Achilles is highly amusing. In moments like that, we see that Peterson and O’Hare have approached the material with great respect, but not necessarily with reverence.
Hatley creates the illusion of spontaneity, as if every word and gesture are happening in the moment, raw and unrehearsed. Toward the end he lets us see that the Poet pays a steep price in recounting the Trojan War, whose tales of heroism and spectacle lead to a grim, devastating conclusion.
A second man onstage is the Musician, played by Raymond Castrey, the show’s musical director. Castrey isn’t always there, but when he is he makes a remarkable, nonverbal contribution. He is the first person we see, setting the tone by evoking a Middle Eastern feel from a ukulele. 
During the show he also performs on a mountain dulcimer and a range of percussion instruments, some of which are built into the set. You get the idea that the Musician has gathered instruments where he finds them in his endless travels. Although Castrey never speaks, he and Hatley achieve a rapport that adds color, texture and depth to the production. 
If I could, I would see this show again. There’s so much to savor, despite its brevity. As my acquaintance in the lobby remarked, he didn’t want it to end.

-=-=-TEXT: Re: What do proper historians make of Islam?
 Quote: : To answer the question:
Edward Gibbon (1737-1794) Considered the greatest British historian of his time. OK. If you are going to use Gibbon as the example of one of the world's greatest historians and Quote: him on Islam, then you must accept all his opinions on the subject. Like his assessment of the "linguistic miracle" for example.
"In the spirit of enthusiasm or vanity, the prophet rests the truth of his mission on the merit of his book; audaciously challenges both men and angels to imitate the beauties of a single page; and presumes to assert that God alone could dictate this incomparable performance. This argument is most powerfully addressed to a devout Arabian , whose mind is attuned to faith and rapture; whose ear is delighted by the music of sounds; and whose ignorance is incapable of comparing the productions of human genius . The harmony and copiousness of style will not reach, in a version, the European infidel: he will peruse with impatience the endless incoherent rhapsody of fable, and precept, and declamation, which seldom excites a sentiment or an idea, which sometimes crawls in the dust, and is sometimes lost in the clouds. The divine attributes exalt the fancy of the Arabian missionary; but his loftiest strains must yield to the sublime simplicity of the book of Job, composed in a remote age, in the same country, and in the same language. If the composition of the Koran exceed the faculties of a man to what superior intelligence should we ascribe the Iliad of Homer, or the Philippics of Demosthenes? " - The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire
So you accept Gibbon's view of the Quran.

-=-=-SNIPPET:  Sing, Goddess, of the anger of Achilles... The story of Homer
-=-=-TEXT: "Sing, Goddess, of the anger of Achilles..." 
The story of Homer's Iliad begins in the middle of the Trojan War, just at the end of the Bronze Age in Greece. (To find out about the beginning of the war, click here). We don't know if there ever really was a Trojan War, but even if there was, this is a story about it, not a real memory of it. 
 The Greeks believed that the Trojan War lasted for ten years, and this story happens in the tenth year of the war, when both sides were really sick of being at war, and the Greeks were sick of being away from home.
The Iliad begins with a fight between the leader of the Greeks, King Agamemnon of Mycenae, and the Greeks' best fighter, King Achilles (uh-KILL-eez). (The Greeks lived in a lot of little city-states, and in the Bronze Age each one had its own king, but Agamemnon was leading them all during the war). The Greeks had won a battle and were splitting up the booty (the stuff they had captured). Everybody had a pile of stuff. Achilles had gotten a woman among his stuff, to be his slave, whose name was Briseis (brih-SAY-iss). But Agamemnon decided that HE wanted the pretty Briseis, and he just took her from Achilles, saying that he was the head of the army so he would do what he liked. 
 Well, Achilles was so angry that Agamemnon took Briseis from him that he refused to fight for the Greeks anymore and just sat in his tent and sulked. Without their best fighter, the Greeks started losing battles.
Finally Achilles' best friend Patroclos thought of an idea. He put on Achilles' famous armor and went out to fight. Both the Greeks and the Trojans thought Achilles had come back to the battle and the Greeks won a big victory, but Patroclos was killed in the fighting: he might dress like Achilles but he could not fight like him. 
 When Achilles heard that Patroclos was dead, he was ashamed of how he had been sulking. He agreed to fight again. Now the Greeks really started to win. So the best Trojan fighter, Prince Hector, came out from Troy to fight Achilles. They fought for a long time, but finally Achilles killed Hector.
Hector's father, King Priam, came to Achilles at night to ask for his son's body back, and Achilles gave it to him.

-=-=-TEXT: Goddess, sing me the anger, of Achilles, Peleus’ son, that fatal anger that brought countless sorrows on the Greeks, and sent many valiant souls of warriors down to Hades, leaving their bodies as spoil for dogs and carrion birds: for thus was the will of Zeus brought to fulfilment. Sing of it from the moment when Agamemnon, Atreus’ son, that king of men, parted in wrath from noble Achilles.  
            Which of the gods set these two to quarrel? Apollo, the son of Leto and Zeus, angered by the king, brought an evil plague on the army, so that the men were dying, for the son of Atreus had dishonoured Chryses the priest. He it was who came to the swift Achaean ships, to free his daughter, bringing a wealth of ransom, carrying a golden staff adorned with the ribbons of far-striking Apollo, and called out to the Achaeans, above all to the two leaders of armies, those sons of Atreus:  ‘Atreides, and all you bronze-greaved Achaeans, may the gods who live on Olympus grant you to sack Priam’s city, and sail back home in safety; but take this ransom, and free my darling child; show reverence for Zeus’s son, far-striking Apollo.’
Then the rest of the Achaeans shouted in agreement, that the priest should be respected, and the fine ransom taken; but this troubled the heart of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, and he dismissed the priest harshly, and dealt with him sternly: ‘Old man, don’t let me catch you loitering by the hollow ships today, and don’t be back later, lest your staff and the god’s ribbons fail to protect you. Her, I shall not free; old age will claim her first, far from her own country, in Argos, my home, where she can tend the loom, and share my bed. Away now; don’t provoke me if you’d leave safely.’
            So he spoke, and the old man, seized by fear, obeyed. Silently, he walked the shore of the echoing sea; and when he was quite alone, the old man prayed deeply to Lord Apollo, the son of bright-haired Leto:  ‘Hear me, Silver Bow, protector of Chryse and holy Cilla, high lord of Tenedos: if ever I built a shrine that pleased you, if ever I burned the fat thighs of a bull or goat for you, grant my wish: Smintheus, with your arrows make the Greeks pay for my tears.’
            So he prayed, and Phoebus Apollo heard him. Down he came, in fury, from the heights of Olympus, with his bow and inlaid quiver at his back. The arrows rattled at his shoulder as the god descended like the night, in anger. He set down by the ships, and fired a shaft, with a fearful twang of his silver bow. First he attacked the mules, and the swift hounds, then loosed his vicious darts at the men; so the dense pyres for the dead burned endlessly.  
For nine days the god’s arrows fell on the army, and on the tenth Achilles, his heart stirred by the goddess, white-armed Hera, called them to the Place of Assembly, she pitying the Danaans, whose deaths she witnessed. And when they had assembled, and the gathering was complete, swift-footed Achilles rose and spoke: ‘Son of Atreus, if war and plague alike are fated to defeat us Greeks, I think we shall be driven to head for home: if, that is, we can indeed escape death. But why not consult some priest, some prophet, some interpreter of dreams, since dreams too come from Zeus, one who can tell why Phoebus Apollo shows such anger to us, because of some broken vow perhaps, or some missed sacrifice; in hopes the god might accept succulent lambs or unmarked goats, and choose to avert our ruin.’
            He sat down again when he had spoken, and Calchas, son of Thestor, rose to his feet, he, peerless among augurs, who knew all things past, all things to come, and all things present, who, through the gift of prophecy granted him by Phoebus Apollo, had guided the Greek fleet to Ilium. He, with virtuous intent, spoke to the gathering, saying: ‘Achilles, god-beloved, you ask that I explain far-striking Apollo’s anger. Well, I will, but take thought, and swear to me you’ll be ready to defend me with strength and word; for I believe I’ll anger the man who rules the Argives in his might, whom all the Achaeans obey. For a king in his anger crushes a lesser man. Even if he swallows anger for a while, he will nurse resentment till he chooses to repay. Consider then, if you can keep me safe.’
            Swift-footed Achilles spoke in reply: ‘Courage, and say out what truth you know, for by god-beloved Apollo to whom you pray, whose utterances you grant to the Danaans, none shall lay hand on you beside the hollow ships, no Danaan while I live and see the earth, not even if it’s Agamemnon you mean, who counts himself the best of the Achaeans.’
            Then the peerless seer took heart, and spoke to them, saying: ‘Not for a broken vow, or a missed sacrifice, does he blame us, but because of that priest whom Agamemnon offended, refusing the ransom, refusing to free his daughter. That is why the god, the far-striker, makes us suffer, and will do so, and will not rid the Danaans of loathsome plague, until we return the bright-eyed girl to her father, without his recompense or ransom, and send a sacred offering to Chryse; then we might persuade him to relent.’
When he had finished speaking, Calchas sat down, and Agamemnon, the warrior, royal son of Atreus, leapt up in anger; his mind was filled with blind rage, and his eyes blazed like fire. First he rounded on Calchas, with a threatening look: ‘Baneful prophet, your utterance has never yet favoured me; you only ever love to augur evil, never a word of good is spoken or fulfilled! And now you prophesy to the Danaan assembly, claiming the far-striker troubles them because I refused fine ransom for a girl, Chryses’ daughter, and would rather take her home. Well I prefer her to my wife, Clytaemnestra, since she’s no less than her in form or stature, mind or skill. Yet, even so, I’d look to give her up, if that seems best; I’d rather you were safe, and free of plague. So ready a prize at once, for me, I’ll not be the only one with empty hands: that would be wrong: you see for yourselves, my prize now goes elsewhere.’
            Then swift-footed Lord Achilles spoke in answer: ‘Great son of Atreus, covetous as ever, how can the brave Achaeans grant a prize? What wealth is there in common, now we have shared our plunder from the cities which cannot be reclaimed? Give up the girl, as the god demands, and we Achaeans will compensate you, three or four times over, if Zeus ever lets us sack high-walled Troy.’
            Then Lord Agamemnon answered him: ‘Brave you may be, godlike Achilles, but don’t try to trick me with your cleverness. You’ll not outwit me or cajole me. Do you think, since you demand I return her, that I’ll sit here without a prize while you keep yours? Let the great-hearted Achaeans find a prize, one that’s to my taste, so the exchange is equal. If not, then I myself will take yours, or seize and keep that of Ajax or Odysseus. Whoever it is, he’ll be angered. But we can ponder all of that later; for now, let us launch a black ship on the shining sea, crew her, and embark creatures for sacrifice and this fair-faced daughter of Chryses too. One of our counsellors can go as captain,   Ajax , Idomeneus, noble Odysseus or you, son of Peleus, you the most redoubtable of men, and make sacrifice and appease far-striking Apollo.’  
Then, with an angry look, swift-footed Achilles replied: Why, you shameless schemer, why should any Achaean leap to obey your orders to march or wage war? No quarrel with Trojan spearmen brought me here to fight: they have done me no wrong. No horse or cow of mine have they stolen, nor have my crops been ravaged in deep-soiled Phthia, nurturer of men, since the shadowy mountains and the echoing sea lie between us. No, for your pleasure, you shameless cur, we followed to try and win recompense, for you and Menelaus, from the Trojans. And you neither see nor care; and even threaten to rob me of my prize, given by the sons of   Achaea , reward for which I laboured. When the Achaeans sack some rich Trojan city, it’s not I who win the prize. My hands bear the brunt of the fiercest fight, but when the wealth is shared, yours is the greater, while I return, weary with battle, to the ships, with some small fraction for my own. So now I’m for Phthia, since it’s better to lead my beaked ships home than stay here dishonoured piling up wealth and goods for you.’
            Agamemnon, king of men, answered him then: ‘Be off, if your heart demands it; I’ll not beg your presence on my account. Others, who’ll honour me, are with me: Zeus, above all, the lord of counsel. Of all the god-beloved princes here you are most odious to me, since war, contention, strife are dear to you. If you are the greatest warrior, well, it was some god I think who granted it. Go home, with your ships and men, and lord it over the Myrmidons: I care naught for you, or your anger. And here’s my threat: since Phoebus Apollo robs me of Chryses’ daughter, a ship and crew of mine will return her, but I’ll pay your quarters a visit myself, and take that prize of yours, fair-faced Briseis, so that you know how my power exceeds yours, and so that others will think twice before claiming they’re my peers, and comparing themselves to me, face to face.’
While Agamemnon spoke, the son of Peleus was gnawed by pain, and the heart in his shaggy breast was torn; whether to draw the sharp blade at his side, scatter the crowd, and kill the son of Atreus, or curb his wrath and restrain his spirit. As he pondered this in his mind, his great sword half-unsheathed, Athene descended from the sky, sent by Hera, the white-armed goddess, who loved and cared for both the lords alike. Athene, standing behind the son of Peleus, tugged at his golden hair, so that only he could see her, no one else. Achilles, turning in surprise, knew Pallas Athene at once, so terrible were her flashing eyes. He spoke out, with winged words, saying: ‘Why are you here, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus? Is it to witness Agamemnon’s arrogance? I tell you and believe that this son of Atreus’ will pay soon with his life for his insolent acts.’
            The goddess, bright-eyed Athene, replied: ‘I came from the heavens to quell your anger, if you’ll but listen: I was sent by the goddess, white-armed Hera, who in her heart loves and cares for you both alike. Come, end this quarrel, and sheathe your sword. Taunt him with words of prophecy; for I say, and it shall come to pass, that three times as many glorious gifts shall be yours one day for this insult. Restrain yourself, now, and obey.’
            Then swift-footed Achilles, in answer, said: ‘Goddess, a man must attend to your word, no matter how great his heart’s anger: that is right. Whoever obeys the gods will gain their hearing.’
            So saying he checked his great hand on the silver hilt, and thrust the long sword back into its sheath, obeying the word of Athene; she meanwhile had left for Olympus, for the palace of aegis-bearing Zeus, and rejoined the other gods.  
But, angered still, the son of Peleus, once more turned on Atreides with bitter taunts: ‘You drunkard with a cur’s mask and the courage of a doe, you’ve never dare to take up arms and fight beside your men, or join the Achaean leaders in an ambush. You’d sooner die. You’d rather steal the prize from any Achaean in this great army who contradicts you. Devourer of your own people you are, because they are weak, or else you, Atreides would have perpetrated your last outrage. But I say true, and swear a solemn oath See this staff, that will never leaf or sprout again now it is severed from its mountain branch, doomed never to be green again, stripped by the bronze adze of its foliage and bark, now borne in their hands by the Achaean judges who defend the laws of Zeus: I swear, on this, a solemn oath to you, that a day will surely come when the Achaeans, one and all, shall long for Achilles, a day when you, despite your grief, are powerless to help them, as they fall in swathes at the hands of man-killing Hector. Then you will feel a gnawing pang of remorse for failing to honour the best of the Achaeans.’
            So spoke the son of Peleus, flung down the gold-studded staff, and resumed his seat; while, opposite, Atreides raged at him. But then soft-spoken Nestor rose, the clear-voiced orator of Pylos, from whose tongue speech sweeter than honey flowed. He had already seen the passing of two mortal generations born and reared with him in holy Pylos, and now he ruled the third. He spoke to the assembly, then, with benevolent intent: ‘Well, here is grief indeed to plague   Achaea . How Priam and his sons would rejoice, and the hearts of the Trojan throng be gladdened, if they could hear this tale of strife between you two, the greatest of Danaans in war and judgement. You are both younger than I, so listen, for I have fought beside warriors, better men than you, who ever showed me respect. I have never seen the like of them since, men such as Peirithous, and Dryas, the people’s Shepherd, Caeneus, Exadius, godlike Polyphemus, and Aegeus’ son Theseus, one of the immortals. They were the mightiest of earth-born men; the mightiest and struggled with the mightiest, the Centaurs that lair among the mountains, whom they utterly destroyed. They summoned me, and I joined them, travelling far from Pylos. I held my own among them, though against them no man on earth could fight. Yet they listened to my words, and followed my advice. You too should do the same, for that is wise. Great as you may be, Atreides, do not seek to rob him of the girl, leave him the prize that the Achaeans granted; and you Achilles, son of Peleus, do not oppose the king blow for blow, since the kingly sceptre brings no little honour to those whom Zeus crowns with glory. You have your power, a goddess for a mother, yet he is greater, ruling over more. Agamemnon, quench your anger, relent towards Achilles, our mighty shield against war’s evils.’
‘Old man, indeed you have spoken wisely’, replied Agamemnon. But this man wants to rule over others; to lord it, be king of all, and issue orders, though I know one who will flout him. What though the immortal gods made him a spearman; does that give him the right to utter such insults?’
            Achilles then interrupted, saying: ‘A coward, and worthless, I’d be called, if I gave way every time to you no matter what you say. Command the rest if you wish, but give me no orders, I’ll no longer obey. And here’s another thing for you to think on: I’ll not raise a hand to fight for the girl, with you or any other, since you only take back what you gave. But you’ll take nothing else of mine by the swift black ships, against my will. Come, try, and let these men be witness: your blood will flow dark along my spear.’
            When their war of words was over, they both rose, and so ended the gathering by the Achaean ships. Achilles left for his fine fleet and his huts, with Patroclus, son of Menoetius, and his men; while Agamemnon launched a swift ship in the waves, chose twenty oarsmen, and embarked an offering for the god, then sent the fair-faced daughter of Chryses aboard, with Odysseus, that man of resource, to take command.  
            While they embarked and set sail on the paths of the sea, Atreides ordered his men to purify themselves, and wash the dirt from their bodies in salt-water, and offer Apollo a sacrifice of unblemished bulls and goats, by the restless waves; and the savour went up to heaven with trails of smoke.  
Though the camp was busy with all this,    Agamemnon   did not forget his quarrel with Achilles, or his threats, and he summoned his heralds and trusty attendants,    Talthybius   and    Eurybates  , saying: ‘Go to    Achilles  ’ hut, seize the fair-faced    Briseis   and bring her here. If he refuses to release her, I’ll go in force to fetch her, and so much the worse for him.’
            With this stern command, he sent them on their way, and unwillingly the two made their way along the shore of the restless sea, till they came to the ships and huts of the    Myrmidons  . They found Achilles seated by his black ship, by his hut, and it gave him no pleasure to see them. Seized by fear and awe of the king, they stood silently; but he in his heart knew their unspoken request, and said: ‘Welcome, heralds, you ambassadors of    Zeus   and men, approach me. You bear no guilt, only Agamemnon, who sends you here for Briseis. Come,    Patroclus  , divinely born, bring out the girl, and hand her to these men. If ever there is need of me to save the Greeks from disaster, let them bear witness to this before the blessed gods, mortal men and that shameless king. His mind raves destructively, indeed, and he fails to look behind him or foresee what might save his Achaeans in the coming fight beside the ships.’
            At this, Patroclus obeyed his order, and leading fair-faced Briseis from the hut, handed her to the heralds, who returned beside the line of Achaean ships, with the unwilling girl. But Achilles withdrew from his men, weeping, and sat by the shore of the grey sea, gazing at the shadowy deep; and stretching out his arms, passionately, prayed to his dear    mother  : ‘Since you bore me to but a brief span of life, Mother, surely Olympian Zeus the Thunderer ought to grant me honour; but he grants me none at all. I am disgraced indeed, by that son of Atreus, imperious Agamemnon, who in his arrogance has seized and holds my prize.’
Tearfully, he spoke, and his lady mother heard him, in the sea’s depths, where she sat beside her aged father. Cloaked in mist she rose swiftly from the grey brine, and sitting by her weeping son caressed him with her hand, and spoke to him calling him by name: ‘Child, why these tears? What pain grieves your heart? Don’t hide your thoughts; speak, so I may share them.’
            Then swift-footed Achilles sighed heavily and spoke: ‘You must know; why need I tell the tale to you who know all? We sacked Thebe, Eetion’s sacred city, and brought back all the spoils, which the Achaeans shared out fairly between them, choosing the fair-faced daughter of Chryses for Agamemnon. Then Chryses, the priest of far-striking Apollo, came to the swift ships of the bronze-clad Greeks to free his daughter with a rich ransom, bearing far-striking Apollo’s ribbons on a golden staff, and begged her freedom of the Achaeans, chiefly the Atreidae, leaders of armies. The Greeks called out their wish, to respect the priest and accept the fine ransom, but this displeased Agamemnon who sent him packing, and with a stern warning. So, angrily, the old man returned, and Apollo, who loved him dearly, heard his prayer, and fired arrows of evil at the Argives. Then men died thick and fast and the god’s darts rained down on the broad camp. At last a seer with knowledge uttered the archer god’s true oracle. I was the first to urge them, there and then, to propitiate the god, but anger gripped that son of Atreus, swiftly he rose and threatened what now has come to pass. Bright-eyed Achaeans in a fast ship are bearing the girl to Chryse with offerings for the god; while heralds have taken from my hut another girl, Briseis, my prize from the army, and led her away. If you have power, come now, to your son’s aid; ask help from Zeus on   Olympus , if ever you warmed his heart by word or deed. Often I heard you, in my father’s halls, claim proudly that you alone of the immortals saved Zeus, son of Cronos, lord of the storm, from a vile fate when those other Olympians, Hera, Poseidon, and Pallas Athene, planned to bind him fast. Goddess, you swiftly summoned, to high Olympus, the hundred-handed monster whom gods call Briareus, and men Aegaeon, mightier than his father Poseidon; and you saved Zeus from those bonds. For Briareus seated himself, in his strength, beside that son of Cronos, and the sacred gods in fear left Zeus alone.  Kneel beside Zeus, and clasp his knees, remind him of that, in hope he might now choose to help the Trojans, pin down the Achaeans among their ships, slaughter them on the shore, so they may reap their king’s reward, and imperious Agamemnon may realise his blindness (ate) in dishonouring the best of the Greeks.’
‘Oh, my son,’ Thetis sadly replied, ‘is it for this I bore you, unlucky in my labour? Since your life is doomed to be brief, filling so short a span, if only it were your fate to stay by the ships, free of pain and sorrow; but you, more wretched than other men, must meet an early death; such is the painful destiny for which I brought you into this world. Yet I’ll go myself to snowy Olympus, and tell the Thunder-bearer Zeus what you have said, hoping that he will hear me. Sit by your swift sea-going boats, meanwhile, nurse your anger against the Achaeans, hold back from the fight; for Zeus has left for Ocean’s stream, to banquet with the peerless Ethiopians, and all the gods go with him; but twelve days hence he returns to Olympus, and then I’ll cross the bronze threshold of his palace, kneel at his feet, and I think persuade him.’ With this, she left him to his anger, caused by their seizing of that lovely girl, against his will.
            Meanwhile Odysseus had touched at Chryse, bearing the sacrifice. Entering the deep harbour, they furled the sail and stowed it in the black ship, dropped the mast by lowering the forestays, and rowed her to her berth. Then they cast out the anchor stones, made fast the hawsers, and leapt on shore. Next, the offering of cattle for far-striking Apollo was disembarked, and Chryses’ daughter landed from the sea-going boat. It was Odysseus, that man of resource, who led her to the altar, and handed her to her dear father, saying: ‘Chryses, our leader Agamemnon commanded me to return your daughter, and make holy sacrifice to Phoebus for all the Greeks, and propitiate your lord Apollo, who has brought the Argives pain and mourning.’ With this, he handed her to her father who joyfully clasped her in his arms.  
            Swiftly now they tethered the offering of cattle around the well-built altar, rinsed their hands and took handfuls of sacrificial barley grains. Then Chryses raised his arms and prayed on their behalf: ‘Hear me, God of the Silver Bow, protector of Chryse and holy Cilla, lord of Tenedos. Just as once before when I prayed to you, you honoured me and struck the Achaeans a fierce blow, so grant my new plea, and avert this dreadful scourge from the Danaans.’ So he prayed, and Apollo listened.
            When they had offered their petition and scattered grains of barley, they drew back the victims’ heads, slit their throats and flayed them. Then they cut slices from the thighs, wrapped them in layers of fat, and laid raw meat on top. These the old man burnt on the fire, sprinkling over them a libation of red wine, while the young men stood by, five-pronged forks in their hands. When the thighs were burnt and they had tasted the inner meat, they carved the rest in small pieces, skewered and roasted them through, then drew them from the spits. Their work done and the meal prepared, they feasted and enjoyed the shared banquet, and when they had quenched their first hunger and thirst, the young men filled the mixing-bowls to the brim with wine and pouring a few drops first into each cup as a libation served the gathering. All that day the Achaeans made music to appease the god, singing the lovely paean, praising the god who strikes from afar; while he listened with delight.  
            And at sunset as darkness fell, they lay down to sleep by the ships’ cables, and when rosy-fingered Dawn appeared they sailed for the distant camp of the Achaeans. Then far-striking Apollo sent them a following wind, and they raised the mast and spread the white sail. The canvas bellied in the wind and the dark wave hissed at the stern, as the boat gathered way and sped through the flood, forging on its course. So they came to the broad camp of the Achaeans, dragged the black vessel high on shore, and propped her with lengths of timber, then dispersed among the huts and ships.  
But swift-footed Achilles, heaven-born son of Peleus, still nursed his anger beside the swift ships. He avoided the Assembly where men win renown, and kept from battle, eating his heart out where he was, longing for the noise of battle.  
            At dawn on the twelfth day, the company of immortal gods, led by Zeus, returned to Olympus. Thetis had not forgotten her promise to her son, and at morning, emerging from the waves, she rose to the broad sky and   Olympus . There she found Zeus, he of the far-thundering voice, sitting apart on the highest peak of ridged  Olympus . She sank in front of him, clasped his knees with her left arm, raised her right hand to touch his chin, and so petitioned the son of Cronos: ‘Father Zeus, if ever I helped you by word or deed, grant me this wish, honour my son, who is doomed to die young. For Agamemnon the king shows disrespect, arrogantly seizing his rightful prize. Avenge my son, Olympian Zeus, lord of justice; enhance the Trojans’ power, till the Greeks honour and respect my son and make amends.’
            Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, made no reply to her words, he sat there silently. But Thetis, still clasping his knees, clung to him and pleaded again: ‘Make me this promise faithfully, and nod your head, or else refuse, for I am powerless, then I shall know how little I am honoured here.’
            Zeus, the cloud-lord, deeply troubled, said: ‘This is a sorry business, indeed, and you will force a quarrel with Hera. She will taunt and rile me. As it is, she scolds me endlessly before the other gods, claiming I aid the Trojans in battle. Go now, before she notices, while I think the matter through. Come, I will nod my head, to reassure you, since you immortals know this as my sure pledge; once I give the nod, my word can never be recalled, it proves true and is fulfilled.’
            So spoke the son of Cronos, inclining his shadowed brow till the ambrosial locks, on the King’s immortal head, stirred together, and high   Olympus  shook.  
So ended their meeting, and Thetis plunged from gleaming   Olympus  to the briny deep, while Zeus left for his palace. There the company of gods rose to their feet in deference to their father; none daring to stay seated at his entry, all standing as one. He took his royal place, but Hera, watching, could not fail to know that silver-footed Thetis, daughter of the Old Man of the Sea, had pleaded with him. At once she goaded Zeus, Cronos’ son: ‘What immortal has sought your counsel, arch-deceiver? It’s ever your delight to work behind my back, and make all your decisions in secret. When did you ever openly discuss your plans with me?’
            ‘Hera’ replied the father of men and gods, ‘do not expect to know all my thoughts: though you are my wife you would find it a burden. Whatever it is right for you to hear, no immortal, no human, shall know before you; but of what I plan without reference to the gods, make no question, do not ask.’
            ‘Dread son of Cronos,’ the ox-eyed queen replied, ‘what is this? I have never questioned you, nor asked: you have ever peace to think on what you wish. But now my heart fears silver-footed Thetis, daughter of the Old Man of the Sea, has swayed you; for she knelt by you at dawn and clasped your knees. Dare I imagine that you bowed to her, gave her a firm pledge of support for Achilles, and promised slaughter by the Greek ships?’  
            Then cloud-gathering Zeus replied: ‘You’re obsessed, forever brooding. I can hide nothing from you, yet you’ll achieve nothing too, only estrange us, and so much the worse for you. If things are as you think, then is it not because I wish them so? Now sit there, quiet, and obey me; lest I set my all-powerful hands on you, and all the gods of   Olympus  lack the strength save you.’
At this, the ox-eyed queen trembled, restrained herself and sat down silently. All the immortal gods there were troubled, and it was Hephaestus, famed for his skill, who broke the silence, hoping to calm his mother, white-armed Hera: ‘This is a sorry business. It’s intolerable you two should quarrel over a mortal, and set the gods at odd with one another. What joy in a good banquet if animosity prevails? I advise my mother, who herself knows this is best, to make peace with our dear father, Zeus, lest he reprimand her again and our feast be ruined. What if the Olympian lord of lightening, mightiest of us all by far, should choose to blast us where we sit! Mother, speak gentle words to him, and the Olympian will once more show us grace.’
            So saying, he hurried to his dear mother, and placed a two-handled cup in her hands: Be patient, mother, and contain your anger, lest you who are dear to me are beaten while I look on. For all my pain, there’s no way I could help you, the Olympian is a tough antagonist to face. Once before, when I rushed to save you, he seized me by the foot and hurled me from heaven’s threshold; all day headlong I plunged, and fell, with the sun, half-dead, to Lemnos’ shore. There the Sintians ran to nurse me from my fall.’
            The white-armed goddess, Hera, smiled at this, and took the cup from her son, still smiling. Then he served wine to all the other gods, starting on the left, pouring sweet nectar from the mixing-bowl. And immortal laughter rose from the bliss-filled gods, as they watched Hephaestus bustling about the hall.  
            So they banqueted all day till sunset, missing nothing of the shared feast, nor of the lovely lyre Apollo played, nor of the singing Muses, who answered each other in sweet harmony.
            But when the sun’s bright light had faded, each went off to rest in their separate houses, built with rare skill by the god lamed in both feet, famous Hephaestus; and Olympian Zeus, the lord of lightning, ascended to his accustomed bed to find sweet sleep, with Hera of the golden throne beside him.

-=-=-TITLE: Deutsche Telekom’s revenue rises 13%
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast pre-tax earnings of €4.4bn. Revenues rose from €14.9bn to €16.8bn. 
The company benefited from the weakness of the euro. 
It was also boosted by T-Mobile US , the fourth-largest wireless carrier in the country and in which the German company has a majority stake, which gained a net 1.8m customers in the first quarter, taking its total to 56.8m. 
Deutsche Telekom has pledged to return more cash to shareholders over the next four years as it expects growth of its US subsidiary to boost profits. 
The company’s optimism is an indication of growing confidence in a European telecoms sector that has suffered from recession and fierce price competition. 
Timotheus Höttges, chief executive, said: “It has been some time since we have seen positive indications for revenue and earnings in our industry. Our clear strategy with strong investment is paying off.” 
T-Mobile US contributed 41 per cent of the group’s net revenue in the last quarter, the single biggest contribution and an increase of 7 percentage points on the year before. Germany remains the operating segment with the best profit margin. 
Deutsche Telekom last year rejected a $15bn takeover offer from Iliad, the French telecoms group, for its US unit. Sprint, the third-biggest US wireless carrier which is owned by SoftBank of Japan, abandoned a takeover last year after failing to win over regulators. 
In a note to clients, analysts at Berenberg bank warned that Deutsche Telekom’s upbeat outlook depended on US competitors remaining “acquiescent”. 
“We increasingly find ourselves asking when was the last time two large incumbent mobile operators stood by and allowed a disrupter to take huge amounts of market share without eventually responding,” they wrote. 
Deutsche Telekom’s net profit for the quarter fell 56.7 per cent year-on-year to €787m. The relative decline was due to the company booking income from the sale of a stake in Scout24, the German classifieds portal, in the first quarter of 2014. 
Shares in Deutsche Telekom closed down 3.6 per cent to €16.01. Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2015. You may share using our article tools. Please don't cut articles from FT.com and redistribute by email or post to the web.

During the hunt for the Clairvoyant, S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Victoria Hand, Jasper Sitwell, Felix Blake, John Garrett, and Antoine Triplett made their way to the S.H.I.E.L.D. Aircraft Carrier to meet with Agent Phil Coulson. Upon Coulson's arrival, all six Agents departed in the Bus for the Arctic Circle.[1]
During the S.H.I.E.L.D. Civil War, S.H.I.E.L.D. suffered heavy casualties at the hands of HYDRA, losing many bases and most of its equipment to the reborn terrorist organization. HYDRA's moles on the Iliad attempted to take possession of the ship, but the loyal S.H.I.E.L.D. agents managed to defeat them all. During the battle, Agent Robert Gonzales was almost killed but he was saved by Agent Isabelle Hartley. 
The remaining S.H.I.E.L.D. agents on the Iliad continued to operate the ship, which eventually became the mobile headquarters of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s remnants led by Robert Gonzales.[2]

-=-=-TEXT: For each class, I suggest that you first read          the assigned text "cold," using only the notes. Just go          through it and let yourself be confused, if that happens.          (None of the readings is all that long: most of them are          under 20 pages; the few that are longer are easier reading.)          Second, read the supplementary material, if any is          assigned (passages from the "Introduction" and the like).          Third, read the Background Material on this site.          Fourth, reread the assigned text. Now you should          understand it better and you should have answers to some of          the questions that will have arisen in the course of your          initial reading. Fifth, consult the Illustration and          Study Questions site on the Web, and spend some time          thinking about the issues raised there.
          As a general rule, for each class hour at Wesleyan, you are          expected to spend three hours of preparation time. Thus, for          each of our classes, which meet for an hour and 20 minutes,          you should plan to spend about four hours in preparation          time. For many classes, you will not need this much time.          When you have time left over, you should spend it thinking          about your paper, beginning a draft, and/or commenting on          other students' papers.
 Book          I: Theme and Plot
(Note: The following assumes that          you have already read the Plot Summary in the "Introduction"          to Fagles' Iliad [pages          3-5])
The theme of the Iliad is the "Rage of Achilles,"          announced in the first line of the poem. Achilles' rage is          aroused as a result of the quarrel with Agamemnon in Book I,          and it takes the concrete form of his withdrawal from the          fighting. In Book XIX, Achilles returns to battle, but now          his rage has shifted toward Hector, the killer of Achilles'          friend Patroclus. This new manifestation of rage does not          abate until Book XXIV, when Achilles agrees to return          Hector's body to Priam.
          The action of the Iliad thus encompasses only one          episode which is about two months' long in the final year          (the tenth year) of the ten-year war against Troy. Aristotle          admired this aspect of the Iliad, and said that a          poem about the whole war would have been too long and bulky          for comprehension. (See Aristotle, Poetics,          Chapters          8 , 23 .)
 Book          I: Plot Situation
Homer does not specify the "cause" of          the war against Troy until Book XXIV, when he alludes          casually to "the judgment of Paris." See page 589, lines          32-36, and the story of the legend of the Judgment of Paris          on pages 632-33 of the "Notes on the Translation" (Notes to          24.35-36).
          At the beginning of Book I of the Iliad, the war is          in its tenth year. The Greeks have been camped out on the          plain around Troy for many years. According to Thucydides,          the Greeks would have captured Troy easily shortly after          their arrival if they had not been hampered by lack of          provisions. But since they could not bring enough with them,          they were forced to turn to raids and agriculture to          maintain themselves, and this required the dispersal of          their forces. (See Thucydides, History of the          Peloponnesian War, Book          I, Chapter 11 .)
          The text of the Iliad bears out what Thucydides says; for          example, Achilles in Book IX.398-400 claims to have sacked          23 cities:
          "Twelve cities of men I've stormed and sacked from          shipboard,
          eleven I claim by land, on the fertile earth of Troy.
          And from all I dragged off piles of splendid          plunder...."
          It was on one or two such raids that Chryseis and Briseis          were captured. Achilles tells Thetis that the women were          part of the plunder when the town of Thebe was raided: see          lines 430ff.; later, in XIX.68, he says that Briseis was          part of the plunder when he sacked Lyrnessus. For the          locations of Thebe and Lyrnessus, see the map on page 73 of          the text and the annotation          of the map . Chryse, the home          town of Chryses, Apollo's priest, was probably located on          the west coast of the Troad.
          How did Chryseis come to be captured in a raid on Thebe when          her home was in Chryse, some distance away? The ancient          commentators on the Iliad wondered about this too,          and here is what one of them says: Achilles was deterred by          Athena from attacking Chryse, and turned his attention          instead to Thebe, where Chryseis happened to be visiting the          wife of Eetion, Thebe's ruler (see line 433), for the sake          of some religious function, and was caught there during the          raid.
          In any case, after each raid, the plunder was divided among          the army and chief warriors: see Achilles' remarks to Thetis          in lines 433ff. But Chryseis was the daughter of Chryses,          the priest of Apollo. (According to lines 43-45, Chryse,          Cilla and Tenedos were all sacred to Apollo, and Cilla was          probably located near Thebe.) Chryses was thus able to          appeal to Apollo for divine intervention to aid in the          recovery of his daughter, when Agamemnon refused to ransom          her. And so the Iliad begins.
 Book          I: Characters and Names
Thucydides thought that the Greeks,          or Hellenes, were not unified as a distinct people until          after the Trojan War, and he demonstrates this point by          appealing to Homer's use of three separate designations for          the Greek forces: Danaans, Argives and Achaeans. (See          Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War,          Book          I, Chapter 3 .) All three          names appear in Iliad, Book I; see lines 13          (Achaeans), 49 (Danaans) and 70 (Argives). You can get an          idea of the geographical range of the territories from which          the expedition to Troy was made up by consulting the maps on          pages 68-71 of the text, and the map          annotated  to show the          homelands of the major Greek heroes.
Major Greek Heroes (consult also the Glossary          at the back of the text); these short notes are just          designed to help you keep the players straight, and to          clarify for you the separate designations which are used for          each:
Agamemnon, king of Mycenae ,          leader of the expedition, brother of Menelaus, son of          Atreus, also called Atrides (= "son of Atreus")
Achilles, warrior from Phthia ,          leader of the Myrmidons, son of Peleus
Patroclus, Achilles' close friend and companion, son          of Menoetius, originally from Opois in Locris ,          as we find out only in Book XXIII.110-110, when the "shade"          or ghost of the dead Patroclus addresses Achilles. In Book          XI.935ff., where Nestor reminds Patroclus of the          instructions with which each father (Peleus and Meneoetius)          sent his son off to war, it emerges that Patroclus is older          than Achilles.
Menelaus, king of Sparta ,          the capital of Lacedaemon, brother of Agamemnon, son of          Atreus, also called Atrides (= "son of Atreus")
Ajax, son of Telamon, commander of the forces from          Salamis ,          second greatest Greek warrior after Achilles.
Odysseus, son of Laertes, commander of the forces          from Ithaca           and the surrounding islands.
Idomeneus, leader of the forces from Crete ;          he does not appear as a character in any of the Books that          we read.
Nestor, the oldest of the Greek leaders, commander of          the forces from Pylos 
  Olympian          Gods and Goddesses (for further details, see the          Glossary)
          As you will discover when you read Hesiod's Theogony,          the Olympian gods and goddesses are a family and they          comprise the third generation of divinities born from the          union of Gaia (Earth) and Sky (Ouranos).
          The second generation was composed of the Titans, powerful          divinities who were eventually overthrown by Zeus. Among the          Titans were Cronus, Zeus' father, Rhea, Zeus'          mother, Oceanus (Ocean), and Hyperion, the sun          divinity. (Helios, who is the Olympian Sun god, is          Hyperion's son.)
          The Olympians who figure in the Iliad are: Zeus,          Hera, [Poseidon], [Hades], Ares, Hephaestus,          Athena, Aphrodite, Apollo, Artemis, and Hermes.
          Of these, Zeus, Hera, Poseidon and Hades belong to the elder          generation of Olympians, born from the union of Cronus and          Rhea. Ares and Hephaestus were born from the union of Zeus          and Hera; Apollo and Artemis were born from the union of          Zeus and the goddess Leto; Aphrodite was born from the union          of Zeus and Dione, a river nymph; Hermes was born from the          union of Zeus and the goddess Maia; and Zeus gave birth to          Athena himself. Athena is also known as Pallas Athena or          Pallas. Apollo is also called Phoebus Apollo or Phoebus.
          Thus, Ares, Hephaestus, Athena, Aphrodite, Apollo, Artemis,          and Hermes are all the children of Zeus. And although Zeus,          Hera, Hades and Poseidon all belong to the older generation,          Poseidon does not live on Olympus, and neither does Hades,          who is the god of the Underworld. So the Olympian "family"          is made up of Zeus and Hera, the king and          queen of Olympus ,          and their and his children (Ares, Hephaestus, Athena,          Aphrodite, Apollo, Artemis, and Hermes).
          In the Iliad, Hera, Athena, and          Poseidon are the special champions of the Greek          cause, and Ares and Apollo are the chief          defenders of Troy. Aphrodite is also partial to the          Trojans, principally because her son Aeneas is an ally of          the Trojans.
 Book          III: Plot Situation
Link here for a          detailed          summary  of the Books of          the Iliad.
 The Iliad begins, as you          know, in the tenth year of the war. In Books II and III,          Homer himself fills in some of the background, by the plot          device of moving the action forward in a manner that also          allows for a retrospective view of details.
          Thus, in Book II, Agamemnon musters the troops, and this          provides an occasion for Homer to introduce the "catalogue          of ships," an account of how many ships came from where in          Greece, and by whom the battalions on them were led. We find          out, for example, that Agamemnon's forces came in 100 ships          (the largest contingent), and that he gave the Arcadians 60          ships, since they were land-dwellers. (Click          HERE           to see where they lived relative to Agamemnon.) Nestor          brought 90 ships, but most of the other leaders brought 40          ships or fewer. (Achilles brought 50, Odysseus 12, Menelaus          60, Ajax 12.)
          When the Trojans hear that the Achaeans are mustering for          war, they do the same. And this provides the occasion for          Homer to review their forces. Hector was their leader,          commanding "by far the greatest, bravest army" (Book II,          line 928); and after him was the Trojan ally Aeneas. (Click          HERE           to see from where the Trojan allies were drawn.)
          So, when Book III opens, both sides are leading their forces          out onto the Trojan plain. And the duel between Menelaus and          Paris (Alexander) provides an occasion for Helen to come out          to the wall and identify the leaders for Priam (the king of          Troy and Hector's father) and the other elders. It is of          course unlikely that Priam has actually waited ten years to          find out who the leaders of the invading forces are--but          we don't know who they are, and this device allows us          to find that out.
          The leaders identified by Helen (Agamemnon, Odysseus, Ajax          and Idomeneus) are not the only principal Achaean heroes: we          have already encountered Achilles and Nestor in Book I,          Menelaus in Book III, and in Book V Diomedes will be          featured (see below).
          Idomeneus is the leader from Crete (see          map ), and is important in          books of the Iliad that we do not read.
          Ajax is the best of the Achaean warriors after Achilles; he          is the leader from Salamis, also called Telamonian Ajax or          Greater Ajax. This is because there is another Ajax, son of          Oileus, called Oilean or Little Ajax, leader of the forces          from Locris. To see the difference in their homes of origin,          click HERE .
 Book          III: "Helen and all her wealth"
At the beginning of Book III, Paris          proposes a duel between himself and Menelaus "for Helen and          all her wealth." The winner, he says, will take the          treasures and Helen, and then the Trojans and Achaeans will          conclude a truce (lines 84ff., pp. 130-31). What were these          "treasures" and how did Helen come to possess "wealth" in a          society like the (patriarchal) one depicted in the poem?          Commentators have wondered about this, and a modern one          (G.S. Kirk) says, "These [treasures] must be the          possessions, including some that were strictly perhaps          Menelaus' rather than hers, which Helen and Paris took with          them from Lacedaemon [Sparta]." Give some thought to          this matter, and see what you yourselves think about it.          (You might also want to consult Book XXII, lines 136-39,          page 545, where Hector describes the treasures when he is          debating with himself whether to remain outside the walls of          Troy and face Achilles.)
  Book          III: "that first time"
At the end of Book III, Paris recalls          "that first time / when I swept you [Helen] up from          the lovely hills of Lacedaemon" and they went and made love          "on Rocky Island" (lines 519ff., page 143). Where was this          island? Ancient and modern commentators have debated the          question. Some think that the Greek term for "rocky"          (kranae) is a descriptive epithet, and not a proper          name. Some think it was an island called Cranae ,          off Lacedaemon's port of Gytheum ;          others think it was Cythera ;          others think it was the island called Helene           off the south-east coast of Attica. What might each location          have to recommend it, in your opinion?
          About this scenario as a whole, G. S. Kirk thinks that the          idea that Helen managed to bring many possessions with her          is not consonant with the picture here, which envisions "a          swfit and romantic abduction." What do you think? Are the          two scenarios contradictory?
          Note also that, in Book VI, lines 342ff. (page 205), we find          out that Paris either returned from Lacedaemon to Troy by          way of Sidon           in Phoenicia, or else stopped there on his way to Lacedaemon          from Troy.
 Book          VI: Priam's Palace
When Hector enters the city of Troy          and comes to Priam's palace, the structure is described as          having 50 sleeping chambers for the sons of Priam, and 12          for the daughters of Priam (lines 291ff.).
          The ancient Greeks and Romans identified Troy           with the site known in modern times as Hissarlik .          It was excavated by Heinrich Schliemann beginning in 1870,          and in 1890 Schliemann's assistant, Wilhelm          Dörpfeld , identified          Level VI as the one represented in the Iliad.
          According to traditional dating criteria, Homeric Troy was          sacked around 1270 BCE, early in the thirteenth century          BCE.
          Recent archaeological excavations of the site, however, have          established that Troy VI was destroyed around 1350 BCE          (perhaps by earthquake) and that Troy VII was destroyed by          fire around 1250 BCE.
          Contemporary reconstructions of Troy VI as seen          from          the North  and          from          the East , based on the          archaeological evidence and on comparisons with other,          better preserved and more systematically excavated Bronze          Age palaces, attempt to give modern readers a sense of what          Troy might have looked like in the Bronze Age period.
No secure evidence, however, allows us to state          unequivocally that the Trojan War as depicted by Homer ever          took place.
 Book          VI: Priam's Children
Not all of Priam's sons are named in          the Iliad; and of those that are, not all are also          the sons of Hecuba. The twenty sons that are named include:          Hector, Paris, Helenus, Agathon, Antiphonus, Antiphus,          Cebriones, Deiphobus, Democoon, Dius, Doryclus, Gorgythion,          Hippothous, Isus, Lycaon, Mestor, Pammon, Polites,          Polydorus, and Troilus.
          The sons that were born from Hecuba include Hector, Paris,          Deiphobus, Helenus, Troilus, and five others who are minor          figur in the tradition.
          Other sons are identified as the progeny of Castianaira          (Gorgythion) or of Laothoë (Polydorus and Lycaon), and          others are called "bastard sons" (Cebriones, Democoon,          Doryclus, Isus). About the other sons we aren't given any          information which allows us to specify their status.
          Note that in Book XXI, Lycaon says that Priam wed his mother          "with many other wives" (line 100, p. 523), so we can          presume the existence of some form of polygamy. Since other          sons are identified as bastards (see just above), Priam must          have had both several wives and also several concubines.
          (For a list of 47 of Priam's sons, see a passage          in the late mythographer          Apollodorus .)
          In Book XXIV Priam lashes out at nine of his sons (Helenus,          Paris, Agathon, Pammon, Antiphonus, Polites, Deiphobus,          Hippothous, and Dius), saying that he wishes they had died          instead of Hector (lines 294ff., page 596). This group of          sons includes all named sons who are not killed in the          course of the Iliad.
          (Cebriones is killed by Patroclus at VIII.364; Democoon by          Odysseus at IV.576; Doryclus by Great Ajax at XI.577;          Gorgythion by Teucer at VIII.344; Isus by Agamemnon at          XI.118; Antiphus by Agamemnon at XI.121; Lycaon by Achilles          at XXI.129; Polydorus by Achilles at XX.463; Hector by          Achilles in Book XXII; Troilus by an unnamed Achaean at          XXIV.305; and Mestor under unspecified circumstances          [XXIV.305]).
          Priam's daughters who are named in the Iliad include          Cassandra and Laodice, both traditionally Hecuba's          daughters. Six others appear in the tradition, according to          Apollodorus .
          Cassandra is described as "Priam's loveliest daughter" at          XIII.424 (page 353), when her bridegroom Othryoneus is          killed by Idomenus.
Consult the Plot Summary on page 4 of          the Introduction to Fagles' Iliad for an overview of          the action between Books VI and XXII. The main sequence of          events outlined there is:
          the turning of the tide of battle against the Achaeans (Book          VIII),
          the largely unsuccessful embassy to Achilles (Book IX),
          the resumption of battle (Books XII-XV),
          the entry of Patroclus into battle wearing Achilles' armor          (Book XVI),
          the killing of Patroclus by Hector (end of Book XVI),          and
          Achilles' re-entry into battle wearing a new suit of armor          fashioned by Hephaestus (Books XIX-XXI).
          For more detail, see the Detailed          summary of Books of the Iliad .
 At the end of Book XXI,          Achilles has just attacked the Trojan Agenor. But Apollo,          who has come down from Olympus to aid the Trojans, spirits          Agenor off the battlefield, assumes his form, and leads          Achilles out onto the Plain          of Scamander  while the          Trojans retreat en masse within the walls through the Scaean          Gates (lines 591-700, pages 537-40).
          As Book XXII opens, Apollo reveals his deceit to          Achilles.
 Book          XXII: "Polydamas will be the first"
As we find out in Book XI, Polydamas,          along with Aeneas and the three sons of Agenor, are the          commanders of the first Trojan contingent under Hector (Book          XI, lines 64-8, page 298).
          Beginning with Book VIII, the plan of Zeus is put into          action whereby, in accordance with his promise to Thetis in          Book I, the tide of action is turned against the Achaeans.          Hector rises into prominence and leads the Trojan assault          successfully.
          By Book XII the Achaeans have withdrawn behind the wall they          erected around their ships, and Hector prepares to storm it.          Polydamas, however, advises caution, and at first Hector          follows his advice (Book XII, lines 72-101, pages 327-28;          see also Iliad          Summary , Book XII).
          Later, however, Polydamas counsels retreat in the face of an          unfavorable bird-omen, and Hector contemptuously rejects his          advice (Book XII, lines 240-90, pages 332-33).
          At the end of Book XIII, as Achaean resistance grows          stronger, Polydamas once again urges caution, and Hector          heeds his advice (Book XIII, lines 836-70, pages          364-65).
          Finally, in Book XVIII, Achilles signals his readiness to          rejoin the battle by sounding his war-cry. The Achaeans are          heartened, and the Trojans are seized with terror.
          In a council-meeting of the chiefs, Polydamas counsels          retreat, but Hector, for the last time, angrily rejects his          advice. (Book XVIII, lines 280-364, pages 475-77; see also          Iliad          Summary, Book XVIII ).
The Iliad ends with the          funeral of Hector. Just preceding it, Andromache, Hecuba and          Helen (in that order) lead the women in funeral dirges          (lines 850-912, pages 612-14). Consult these to round out          your understanding of the portrayals the three women.

                             The Iliad is about a young sheperd named Paris that really was the son of King Priam ruler of Troy that went to Sparta and stole King Menelaus' wife Helen and the war that followed.
Wrong!!!
That is the Trojan War
The Illiad is about the siege of Troy.
  when he believed kept thinking positivly
The Illiad is about the siege of Troy.

The Iliad is named after the city of Ilion or Ilium, which most people call Troy. ("Iliad" mean "pertaining to Ilium/Ilion" in Greek.)    It was, it turn, named after its fo… under, Ilius. 				(MORE)

Moira are the Fates, Cthonic Deities which are responsible for creating a sense of 'order' in the Iliad. Zeus accesses the Fates by using scales, when determining the fate of … two men in battle or in the case of Troy and Greeks, the fate of civilisations. Men who are 'fated' to die in the Iliad are not even able to be saved by the gods, such as Sarpedon who died even though he was the son of Zeus. 				(MORE)

The Iliad and the Odyssey are two epic poems written by Homer (Ομηρος) around the 9th century BC. They are two of the oldest recorded written works in history.   The Ili… ad deals with a ten-year war between the Greeks and Trojans, called the Siege of Troy, (Ilion=Troy). It centers around Achilles, the great Greek hero who was dipped in the River Styx when he was young and whose only weak spot was his heel. He was killed when Apollo helped one of his enemies shoot an arrow into his heel, which is why we 1) call part of our heel the Achilles' Heel, and 2) call our weak spot our Achilles' Heel.   The Odyssey is about Odysseus's voyage from the war back home to Ithaca, which took another 10 years.   There are many translations of these two poems, including shortened versions which are easier to understand. 				(MORE)

-=-=-TITLE: 3,500-year-old toy stork found in Bulgaria
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: At first glance, it may look like a strange sculpture or even a mangled piece of piping, but this unique object is claimed to be the oldest toy in Europe. This Thracian bronze artefact is thought to be the oldest toy in Europe. It's in the shape of a stork’s head dates to the Late Bronze Age, between 1,500 and 1,200 BC when the Thracians flourished in the region [Credit: Bulgarian News Television] The Thracian bronze artefact in the shape of a stork’s head dates to the Late Bronze Age, between 1,500 and 1,200 BC. It was discovered by locals near the town of Zlatograd in the Rhodope Mountains of Bulgaria and is made from a mixture of bronze and silver. The head of the stork toy can move, which may have allowed children to make it ‘drink’ water. The bird's body takes the form of a tripod. Its eyes are made from the semi-precious gemstone carnelian, which is found locally. In total the cute artefact weighs just over one ounce (30 grams), according to Bulgarian National Television. Associate Professor Krasimir Leshtakov, who teaches prehistory and archaeology at Sofia University said the 3,500-year-old tot is the only one known to date to the Late Bronze Age, making it the oldest known toy in Europe, Archaeology in Bulgaria reported. Archaeologist Nikolay Ovcharov told Bulgaria’s national radio station that the stork toy may have a religious meaning and said that no similar artefacts has ever been found, leading experts to label it a toy.‘It is hard to say what exactly it was used for,’ he said. ‘It may have been a regular children’s toy but it is also quite possible that this item had some kind of a function in the religious practices of the Ancient Thracians, for example, with clairvoyance. However, we have no way of knowing much about that because this period, the second millennium BC, was a time devoid of the written word.’ The stork toy has gone on show in Zlatograd alongside a Thracian knife, which was used for ritual sacrifices. The ancient Thracians were a group of Indo-European tribes living in south eastern Europe from 2,500 BC to 600 AD and several sanctuaries and rock tombs have been found close to the toy’s location, which will be excavated this summer. Dr Ovcharov says the Thacian civilisation blossomed in Rhodope Mountains in the second millennium BC, clustered around rock sanctuaries such as Perperikon, which was an architectural complex perched 1,541 (450 metres) up the side of a rocky hill. Greek writer Homer mentions the mountains in the Iliad and Odyssey, as well as the Thracians’ fine wines. Author: Sarah Griffiths | Source: Mail Online [May 11, 2015]

-=-=-SNIPPET:  The Achaians, under King Agamemnon, have been fighting the Trojans off and on for nine years, trying to retrieve Helen, the wife of Menelaos, and thus Agamemnon
-=-=-TEXT: The Achaians, under King Agamemnon, have been fighting the Trojans off and on for nine years, trying to retrieve Helen, the wife of Menelaos, and thus Agamemnon's sister-in-law. Paris, a son of the king of Troy, kidnaps Helen, who becomes the legendary "Helen of Troy" and "the woman with the face that launched a thousand ships."
Yet, after years of Achaian attacks, Troy remains intact, and the Trojan army remains undefeated. The same cannot be said for the Achaian army. At present, the Achaian troops are dying from a mysterious plague. Hundreds of funeral pyres burn nightly. Finally, Achilles, the Achaians' most honored soldier, calls for an assembly to determine the cause of the plague.
A soothsayer reveals to the army that King Agamemnon's arrogance caused the deadly plague; he refused to return a woman who was captured and awarded to him as a "war prize." Reluctantly, Agamemnon agrees to return the woman, but, as compensation, he says that he will take the woman who was awarded to Achilles, his best warrior.
Achilles is furious, and he refuses to fight any longer for the Achaians. He and his forces retreat to the beach beside their ships, and Achilles asks his mother, the goddess Thetis, if she will ask Zeus, king of the gods, to help the Trojans defeat his former comrades, the Achaians. Zeus agrees to do so.
The two armies prepare for battle, and Paris (the warrior who kidnapped Menelaos' wife, Helen) leaps out and challenges any of the Achaians to a duel. Menelaos challenges him and beats him, but before Paris is killed, the goddess Aphrodite whisks him away to the safety of his bedroom in Troy.
A short truce is called, but it is broken when an over-zealous soldier wounds Menelaos. During the battle that follows, Diomedes, an Achaian, dominates the action, killing innumerable Trojans and wounding Aphrodite, a goddess.
The Trojans seem to be losing, so Hektor returns to Troy to ask his mother to offer sacrifices to Athena. She performs the rituals, but Athena refuses to accept them. Meanwhile, Hektor discovers Paris safe in his bedroom with Helen, and shames him into returning to battle. Then Hektor visits with his wife and their baby son. It is clear that Hektor is deeply devoted to his family, yet feels the terrible weight of his responsibility as commander-in-chief of the Trojan army.
During the fighting that continues, the Achaians begin to falter, and at one point Athena, Zeus' daughter, fears that the entire Achaian army may be slaughtered. Thus, she and Apollo decide to have Hektor challenge one of the Achaian' warriors to a duel in order to settle the war. Telamonian Aias (Ajax) battles Hektor so valiantly that the contest ends in a draw, and a truce is called.
During this break in the fighting, the dead of both armies are buried and given appropriate funeral rites, and the Achaians fortify their defenses with a strong wall and a moat-like ditch.
The fighting resumes, and so many Achaians are slaughtered that Agamemnon suggests that his troops sail for home, but finally he is convinced that he must return to the fighting. Messengers are sent to Achilles, asking him to return to battle, but Achilles is still sulking beside his ships and refuses to fight.
Soon Agamemnon, Diomedes, Odysseus, and old Nestor are all seriously wounded, and Achilles realizes that the Achaians are in danger of imminent defeat. Therefore, he sends his warrior-companion, Patroklos, to find out who the seriously wounded are.
Patroklos talks with old Nestor, one of the wisest of the Achaian soldiers. Nestor asks Patroklos to dress in Achilles' armor and return to battle. The Achaians, he says, will rejoice and have new faith in their death struggle against the Trojans when they think that they see Achilles returning to the battle. In addition, the Trojans will so fear the wrath of the mighty Achilles that they will be easily defeated. Patroklos promises to ask Achilles for permission to use his armor and ride into battle disguised as the mighty warrior.
Meanwhile, Hektor leads a massive Trojan surge against the Achaian wall that stands between the Trojans and the Achaian fleet of ships, and the wall is successfully smashed. The tumult is so deafening that hell itself seems unloosed.
Achilles is watching and realizes that his wish may be granted: The Achaians are about to be annihilated. He sends Patroklos into the fighting, disguised as Achilles himself. The Achaian army rejoices at what they think is the return of Achilles to the fighting, and the Trojans are so terrified that they are quickly swept back to the walls of Troy.
Patroklos' valor seems superhuman. He has killed nine Trojans in a single charge when Apollo strikes him with such fury that Hektor is able to catch him off-guard and thrust a spear through his body. Then some of the most intense fighting of the war follows in a battle to claim Patroklos' body. Finally, the Achaians rescue Patroklos' corpse, and Hektor captures Achilles' armor. Then the Achaians return to the beach, guarding their ships as best they can.
Achilles is filled with overwhelming grief and rage when he learns that his warrior-companion, Patroklos, has been slaughtered. His mother, Thetis, comes to him and advises him that it is fated that he will die if he tries to revenge Patroklos' death. But she says that if Achilles decides to revenge Patroklos' death, she will outfit him in a suit of new armor, made by one of the gods.
Achilles chooses: He will defy certain death and the Trojans in an attempt to punish them for what they (and he) did to Patroklos. Thus, he returns to battle in his new armor and is so successful that he and the Achaians rout the Trojans. He savagely kills Hektor, the Trojans' mightiest warrior. Achilles' anger is not sated, however. He ties Hektor's corpse to his chariot and circles Patroklos' burial mound every day for nine days.
Hektor's parents are so grieved at the barbaric treatment given to their son's corpse that Priam, Hektor's father, goes to Achilles and begs for his son's body. Achilles is moved by Priam's pleas and by the memory of his own father. Consequently, he agrees to cleanse and return Hektor's body.
Hektor's body is given the appropriate cremation rites, and then with mourning and weeping for the noble warrior, the Trojans place his remains in a golden casket and place it in a burial barrow.

Operativ habe der Verlust in den ersten drei Monaten 216 Millionen Euro betragen, teilte Bouygues am Mittwoch mit. Analysten hatten jedoch mit einem höheren Minus gerechnet. Während das Baugeschäft auf dem Heimatmarkt sich schwächer entwickelte, liefen die Geschäfte in der Telekomsparte wieder etwas besser. Im Vorjahr hatte das Unternehmen dank positiver Einmaleffekte einen operativen Gewinn von 18 Millionen Euro ausgewiesen. 
Unter dem Strich stand ein Fehlbetrag von 157 Millionen Euro, nach einem Gewinn von 238 Millionen Euro im Vorjahr. Im ersten Quartal 2014 hatten die Franzosen von einem Anteilsverkauf profitiert. Der Umsatz ging um 2 Prozent auf 6,7 Milliarden Euro zurück. Den Ausblick für das Gesamtjahr bestätigte Bouygues. Der operative Gewinn (Ebitda) im Telekomgeschäft soll 2015 stabil bleiben. Das Unternehmen bekommt schon seit längerem den Preiskampf auf Frankreichs Mobilfunkmarkt zu spüren und streicht deshalb unter anderem in dem Bereich Stellen. 
Bouygues sucht weiter nach einer Lösung für die Telekom-Tochter. Im vergangenen Sommer war ein Zusammenschluss der Sparte mit dem Mobilfunk-Platzhirsch Orange gescheitert. Als Interessent gilt der Kabelkonzern Altice. Der französische Mobilfunkmarkt wird seit 2012 durch die Billigmarke Free des Internetkonzerns Iliad aufgewirbelt. In diesem Jahr soll eine Kooperation mit Numericable-SFR bei der Nutzung der Netze gestartet werden. Unter anderem dadurch würden Abschreibungen von rund 200 Millionen Euro anfallen, hieß es.

-=-=-TEXT: In Homer's Iliad, war is depicted as horrible, bloody, and fruitless.  There are no clear winners in The Iliad. Many people die in vain because of arrogant and emotional decisions made by men.  Achilles directly causes the death of his friend by first refusing to fight, leaving the Greeks at a disadvantage, and then poorly advising his friend Patroclus to join the other fighters.  Even the initial cause of the war, Paris' kidnapping of Helen, a Greek woman, is a rash and selfish act. 
 	The will of Zeus plays an important part in the events of The Iliad.  Zeus' will is infallible, and so, in a way, the events that occur are all destined to happen.  However, there is a small amount of flexibility as to when the events will happen.  This flexibility comes from the intervention of the lesser gods, and the actions of mortal men. Apollo can send a plague on the Greeks, and Aphrodite can rescue Paris from certain death when he is fighting Menelaeus, but in the final outcome, the Greeks will sack Troy, and Paris will die. 
 	When mortals interfere with the will of Zeus, the results are much more tragic. Because they are mortal, their actions have direct influence on their comrades, and their lives.  Gods feel pity when they cannot save a favored mortal, but that pity cannot compare to Achilles' sorrow at the death of Patroclus.
 	Death and fighting is not depicted as glorious in The Iliad. Brave warriors receive fame, gold, food, and women, and the younger Greek fighters thrive on this romantic notion.  However, a closer look at the text shows that Homer describes many deaths in violent, anatomic detail.  Most of these deaths are not important to the plot of the story, but they serve the important purpose of showing the reader that no death is insignificant or easy. These descriptions give The Iliad a "Saving Private Ryan" type of realism. 
 	The Iliad focuses much on Achilles and his internal struggle with his personal will versus the will of Zeus.  However, in the middle of the book, he is almost entirely absent.  This gives Homer the opportunity to show other sides of the conflict, and dirty deeds done by the Greeks and Trojans.  In the time of the Trojan war, there was an unwritten code of heroic conduct that the bravest warriors followed.  Defeated warriors were not always killed. They were sometimes taken prisoner and returned for ransoms of money or gifts.  However, in the Iliad, Homer shows that leniency rarely survives in war.  Diomedes and Odysseus, two respected Greek warriors, sneak into a sleeping Trojan camp and kill many unarmed, dreaming Trojans.  Paris ignores the conduct of a fair fight, and runs away every chance he gets.  And Achilles, after losing Patroclus by Hector's sword, tortures Hector before killing him and treats his body very poorly.  Desecration of a dead body was sacrilege to Greek and Trojan society, and it was a great insult. 
 	Homer's last comments on the futility of war come at the end of the Iliad, and in a peaceful manner. Homer shows a little redemption for the horrible ef

-=-=-TEXT: Iliad
Literary works are       divided into various categories called genres in accordance with       their characteristic form and content. The Iliad1       belongs to the genre of epic. An epic is a long poem which tells       a story involving gods, heroes and heroic exploits. Since the       epic is by its very nature lengthy, it tends to be rather loosely       organized. Not every episode is absolutely necessary to the main       story and digressions are not uncommon. You will notice how different       in this regard is the genre of drama, in which every episode       tends to be essential to the plot and digressions are inappropriate.       The events narrated in epic are drawn from legend rather than       invented by the poet and are typically of great significance       as in the case of the Iliad, which relates an important incident centering around the greatest hero of the Greeks in the Trojan War, the most celebrated war of Greek legend (see Troy for more information on the Trojan War). The epic poet tends to present his narrative impersonally, not drawing attention to himself except occasionally, as in the first line of the Iliad when Homer       addresses the goddess who is the Muse 2       of epic poetry.
1The       word Iliad means "a poem about Ilion [another name       for Troy]." 
2In Greek myth a Muse is one of the nine daughters       of Zeus,       who are goddesses of the arts. See line 604 of the first book       of the Iliad.
When you first read       the Iliad, the beginning of the poem can present some difficulty because it assumes a general familiarity with the war between the Trojans and Greeks that most modern readers, unlike the ancient Greeks, do not possess (see Troy for more information on the Trojan War). You should have no trouble, however, if you keep a few facts in mind. The war had been occasioned by an offense given twenty years earlier to Menelaos,       the Greek king of Sparta, by the Trojan Prince, Paris       (also called Alexandros). Paris, aided by the goddess Aphrodite,       whom he had judged the winner of a beauty contest over the goddesses Athene       and Hera,       had stolen Menelaos's wife, Helen.       In order to recover Helen, Menelaos's brother, Agamemnon,       the powerful king of Mykenai, had gathered together a large force       that included many prominent Greek warriors, themselves either       princes or kings. The greatest of these was the hero, Achilleus,       the central character of the Iliad . The main story of       the poem consists of the experiences of Achilleus within a rather       limited period of time (fifty-four days) in the tenth year of       the war.
Another problem you       might encounter in your first reading of the poem of the language       in which the story is told. After reading even a small portion       of the Iliad one quickly becomes aware of Homer's distinctive       style, which is characterized by the constant repetition of phrases,       whole lines and even whole passages. The name Achilleus is frequently       accompanied by the phrase "of the swift feet".3Apollo       is often described as he "who strikes from afar". Speeches       are repeatedly introduced by phrases such as "Then in answer       again spoke..." and summed up by "So he spoke".       You could no doubt provide numerous other examples of this stylistic       phenomenon. What is most unusual about the recurring descriptive       words applied to the name of a god/goddess,/hero/heroine, or       inanimate things is that, although they are sometimes relevant       to their context, they most often are irrelevant and therefore       seemingly unnecessary. For example, it is helpful to the reader       to have Agamemnon identified once or twice as "lord of men"       and Achilleus called "brilliant" and "of the swift       feet", but the frequent repetition of these descriptive       words throughout the poem reveals that their purpose goes beyond       identification. The description of Apollo in 1.213 as the one       "who strikes from afar" has some relevance because       the god will send a destructive plague into the Achaian       camp by shooting arrows from his silver bow (1.48-51).4       But there are many more of these repeated descriptions which       are totally irrelevant. The Achaian ships are often called "fast"       when they are not in motion. Odysseus       is twice called "crafty" in book one although he engages       in no tricks. The sea is referred to as "barren" for       no apparent purpose. But even the relevant epithets5       lose their relevance when they are constantly repeated, as is       the case with Apollo, who continues to be referred to as he "who       strikes from afar" throughout the rest of book one without       any connection with the action. The problem is further complicated       by the fact that other epithets are also applied to Apollo such       as "King"," Phoibos", "radiant",       "beloved of Zeus", "archer", "who works       from afar", etc. with a similar lack of relevance.

4References to the Iliad will be given by the       book number (before the period) and line numbers (after the period). 
5An epithet is a descriptive word or phrase       that is linked with the name of a person or thing. Remember that       you can also consult the Glossary for terms, as well as characters,       events and places
The reason for the       constant repetitions in the Iliad is that Homer composed       in an oral style, which involved the improvisation of poetry       without the aid of writing. In order to facilitate the adaptation       of his words to the requirements of the dactylic hexameter, the       traditional meter of Greek epic poetry, the oral poet used stock       phrases called formulas, which aided him in filling out various       metrical portions of the line. A character or object in the Iliad       generally has a number of epithets of varying metrical size       used in conjunction with it. The reason for this is that sometimes       a longer epithet is needed to suit the meter, while on other       occasions a shorter one is needed. For example, in lines 58,       84, 364, 489 of book 1 a metrically longer epithet is required       to describe Achilleus; therefore he is referred to as Achilleus       "of the swift feet". But in lines 7 and 292 of the       same book a metrically shorter epithet is needed; therefore he       is called "brilliant".
The term formula       can also be used in reference to other elements larger than the       name plus epithet. A whole line can be formulaic, such as the       line which is regularly employed at the end of a meal:
After they       had put away their desire for eating and drinking
Also formulaic are       whole passages which are repeated in almost exactly the same       language with a closely corresponding sequence of events, as       is evident in the description of a sacrifice and a meal in 1.458-469       and 2.421-432. Messages tend to be repeated or stories retold       in almost exactly the same language.
These repetitions       are essential to the oral style of composition. They not only       aided the poet in composing, but also helped the audience, who       did not have the benefit of a text, to remember the details of       the story. But if these repeated formulas had been just practical       necessities, the Iliad would not have succeeded as poetry.       In addition to their practical purpose, these formulas with their       emphasis on particulars create an indelibly vivid impression       of the characters and the Homeric world in general. Who can forget       "swift-footed Achilleus", "fair-cheeked Briseis,"       "Zeus who gathers the clouds" or "the glancing-eyed       Achaians", "the infinite water"? Some formulas       have an inherent poetic beauty: "Dawn with her rosy fingers",       "Hera of the white arms", "the shadowy mountains       and the echoing sea", etc. The formulaic line which is often       used to describe the death of a hero has a power that survives       its many repetitions:
You will no doubt       find your own favorites in the poem.
Be patient with this       oral style of composition; you will soon become used to it. Also,       don't be put off by the great variety of characters and actions.       The Iliad is something like a very large painting which       contains crowds of people and many insignificant events but focuses       on a central action. These details are not important individually,       but do create an impression of largeness and provide an imposing       background for the main focus of the painting. Confronted for       the first time with a poem with a large cast of characters and       the seemingly countless details of the narrative, you might find       yourself somewhat confused. But if you read carefully and are       willing to reread, you will find that the main story of the Iliad       is fairly simple and involves a relatively small number of       major characters.
The code which governs       the conduct of the Homeric heroes is a simple one. The aim of       every hero is to achieve honor, that is, the esteem received       from one's peers. Honor is essential to the Homeric heroes, so       much so that life would be meaningless without it. Thus, honor       is more important than life itself. As you will notice in reading       the Iliad, when a hero is advised to be careful to avoid       a life-threatening situation in battle, his only choice is to       ignore this warning. A hero's honor is determined primarily by       his courage and physical abilities and to a lesser degree by       his social status and possessions. The highest honor can only       be won in battle. Here competition was fiercest and the stakes       were the greatest. Two other heroic activities, hunting and athletics,       could only win the hero an inferior honor. An even lesser honor       was won by the sole non-physical heroic activity, the giving       of advice in council (1.490; 9.443). Nestor, who is too old to       fight, makes a specialty of giving advice since that is the only       heroic activity left to him (1.254-284).
The heroic ideal       in the Iliad is sometimes offensive to modern sensibility,       but what is required here is not the reader's approval, but understanding       of these heroic values. One can only understand the Iliad,       if one realizes what motivates action in the poem. Indeed, Homeric       heroism is savage and merciless. Thus the hero often finds himself       in a pressure-filled kill-or-be-killed situation. Success means       survival and greater honor; failure means death and elimination       from the competition for honor. But victory in battle is not       enough in itself; it is ephemeral and can easily be forgotten.       Therefore, the victor sought to acquire a permanent symbol of       his victory in the form of the armor of the defeated enemy. As       you will notice, furious battles break out over the corpse as       the victor tries to strip the armor and the associates of the       defeated warrior try to prevent it. Occasionally, prizes from       the spoils of war are awarded for valor in battle as in the cases       of Chryseis and Briseis, who belong respectively to Agamemnon       and Achilleus. The importance of these captive girls as symbols       of honor is evident in the dispute which arises in Book 1. The       Homeric hero is also fiercely individualistic; he is primarily       concerned with his own honor and that of his household,6       which is only an extension of himself. As is particularly true       of Achilleus, the Homeric hero is not likely to be as concerned       about his fellow warriors as he is about himself and the members       of his household. Loyalty to the community or city had not yet       achieved the importance it was going to have in later times.
6The       household, or oikos,       consisted not only of blood relatives, but also of retainers       like Phoinix       and Sarpedon       (12.322-328):
The moral pressure       which ensures compliance with this heroic code is simply what       peers will think and say. The Homeric hero is supremely concerned       with the reaction of his fellow heroes to his actions, since       ultimately it is they alone who can bestow honor. When Hektor's       wife urges him not to re-enter the war, he answers (6.441-443):
Hektor is not free       to walk away from the war. His fear of adverse public opinion       forces him to ignore the pleas of his wife and risk his life       for the sake of honor. Therefore, one must fight courageously,       whatever the cost. As Odysseus says (11.408-410):
The religion of the       ancient Greeks was polytheistic7 and consisted of       the worship of various gods who presided over different aspects       of the physical world and human experience: Zeus,       god of the sky; Aphrodite, goddess of sex; Ares,       god of war, etc. The Greek gods are not spiritual beings but       are anthropomorphic.8 They resemble human beings and       tend to act in a human way, displaying all human emotions, virtues       and vices. Their anthropomorphism is further illustrated by the       patriarchal organization of the divine family, which imitates       the patriarchy9 of human society. Zeus       is the patriarch of the gods, who demands (but does not always       get) the obedience of the other gods. The importance of both       divine and human patriarchy in the Homeric world can be seen       in the frequent use of patronymics1 in the Iliad,       (e.g., Zeus,       son of Kronos; Achilleus, son of Peleus). One of the most important       things that can be said about a god or mortal is the identity       of the father.
7'Characterized       by the worship of many gods'. 
8'Having human characteristics'. 
9'Father-rule'. 
10'A name inherited from a paternal ancestor'.
It should be noted       that Homer's depiction of the gods in the Iliad is more       the result of the poet's inventive imagination than a literal       representation of the gods of actual ancient Greek religious       observance. Homer is more concerned with making the gods suit       the thematic needs of his poem than inspiring religious piety       in his audience. It is quite clear that the gods in the Iliad       on one level act as a foil11 for humanity by accenting       the troubles and sufferings experienced by men through the contrast       with the joys and general ease of divine existence. For this       reason, appearances of the gods in the Iliad are sometimes       characterized by comedy in order to emphasize human misfortune       by contrast. In fact, Herodotus,       the fifth century historian, says that Homer and Hesiod,       an epic poet contemporary with Homer, first named the gods, determined       their honors and functions and devised their physical appearance       (2.53).
11'A       person or thing that emphasizes, through contrast, the distinctive       traits of another person or thing'.
In the Iliad the       gods are very much concerned with human affairs. One reason for       this involvement is the fact that many gods and goddesses who       have mated with mortals have human children or human favorites       participating in the war. The gods take sides in the war in accordance       with their like or dislike of one side or the other. For example,       Athene and Hera, who lost a beauty contest judged by the Trojan       prince Paris, are fiercely anti-Trojan, while the winner Aphrodite       dotes on Paris and favors the Trojans in the war.
The interest and       involvement of the gods in human affairs have an important effect       on the action of the Iliad. The gods universalize       the action of the poem. Because the gods take interest in human       affairs, the events described in the Iliad are not just       particular actions of little significance, but take on a universal       meaning and importance that would have been missing without the       gods. On the one hand, the involvement of the gods exalts human       action. When Achilleus in Book 1 considers killing Agamemnon,       his decision not to kill could have been presented on a purely       human level without the intervention of a deity, but we are shown       exactly just how critical a decision it is by the involvement       of Athene. Throughout the Iliad there is a tendency to       present action consistently on two planes, the human and the       divine. On the other hand, the gods also serve to emphasize the       limitations of man, how short his life is and, quite paradoxically       in view of the previously stated purpose, how ultimately meaningless       human affairs are.
Book 1
First of       all, in order to understand the Iliad you must try to       identify the main theme12 of the poem. Once identified       the main theme will help you separate the essential action of       the Iliad from the action which is not crucial to the       central plot. The main theme is presented by Homer in the first       line of the poem. What is the main theme? Here is the first line       in Greek followed first by a transliteration and then by a word-for-word       translation:
Note the difference       between the word order at the beginning of the line and the normal       English arrangement. How does the Greek word order help you identify       the main theme?
12A       theme in literature is a central idea that gives a literary       work logical unity.
After the introduction       of the poem (1-7), Homer tries to create immediate interest by       thrusting his audience in medias res, 'into the middle       of things'. This Latin phrase is used in literary criticism to       refer to the epic poet's practice of beginning his story without       an introduction to the main characters and an explanation of       the situation which forms the background of the story (i.e.,       without any exposition). The first action of the poem is a suppliancy,       that is, a ritual act, in which the suppliant, while sitting       or kneeling, grasps the knees of the person supplicated and touches       his chin or kisses his hands (see 1.500-501 and 24.478). This       act of self-humiliation was an attempt to forestall any unfavorable       reaction on the part of the supplicated. Once the supplication       was properly performed, the suppliant was under the protection       of Zeus; anyone who rejected a supplication risked the anger       of that god. What request does Chryses make of Agamemnon (20)?       What is the reaction of the Achaians 13(22-23)? What       is Agamemnon's response (26-32)? Why does Chryses pray to Apollo       and what prayer does he make (36-42)? How does Apollo answer       his prayer (43-52)?
13Homer       uses three names, with no apparent difference in meaning, to       refer to the people whom we call Greeks: Achaians, Danaans,       and Argives.
What advice does       Achilleus give to Agamemnon in the midst of the plague (59-67)?       What does Kalchas fear (74-83)? What effect is Achilleus's assurance       of protection to Kalchas (85-91) likely to have on Agamemnon?       What explanation does Kalchas give of the plague (93-100)? What       is Agamemnon's reaction (106-120)? Why does Achilleus say that       Agamemnon should not demand an immediate replacement for Chryseis       (122-129)? What is Agamemnon's answer to Achilleus((131-139)?       Why does Achilleus take Agamemnon's vague threat so personally       (149-171)? What specific threat does Agamemnon make to Achilleus       (181-187)? What is Achilleus's reaction to this threat (188-194)       and what is the result of Athene's intervention (216-221)? What       is the meaning of Achilleus's dashing the sceptre to the ground       (233-246)? What is the purpose of Nestor's       speech (254-284)? What are the reactions of Agamemnon and Achilleus       to this speech (286-303)?
What is Achilleus's       conduct toward the heralds of Agamemnon who come to get Briseis       (334-344)? What important fact do we find out about Achilleus       when he calls to his mother (352-356)? What request does Achilleus       ask Thetis       to make of Zeus (407-412)?
What is the purpose       of the prayer and sacrifice that Chryses makes to Apollo in 451-474?
Describe the feelings       of Achilleus after his decision to withdraw from the war (488-492).       What request does Thetis make of Zeus (505-510)? What is Zeus's       answer and why is he disturbed by the request (518-527)? What       complaint does Hera make to Zeus (540-543)? Why is she disturbed       by Thetis's supplication of Zeus (555-559)? What is Zeus's reaction       to her complaints (545-550; 561-567)? What is Hephaistos's       advice to Hera (573-583)? Why do the gods laugh (599-600)? How       do the events on Mt.       Olympos reflect events on earth in book 1? Compare the result       of the quarrel between Achilleus and Agamemnon and that between       Zeus and Hera. What is the main difference between the quality       of human and divine life?
First, you should       note that the word 'character' is used in literary criticism       in two different ways. It can mean a personage in a literary       work (e.g., Achilleus in the Iliad), or the personal traits       which make such a personage a well defined individual (e.g.,       Achilleus's tendency to anger and his other distinctive characteristics).       The term "character analysis" refers to the examination       of the character's personal traits.
When you attempt       a character analysis, there are a number of things that you must       take into consideration. The personality of any character is       revealed in what the character says, thinks and does, and what       other characters and the author in his own person say about that       character. Although the evaluation of the personality of a character       is most important in a character analysis, you should not neglect       physical appearance and condition, which also can have an important       effect on character and action (e.g., Helen's beauty, Nestor's       and Priam's       old age).
Book 3 is especially       rich in characterization, particularly in reference to the two       people whose actions were the cause of the war - Paris and Helen.       Paris's character is revealed not only by his words and actions,       but also by implicit contrast with his brother Hektor. Helen       is presented as a complex character, who realizes the wrong she       has done and despises Paris, but yet seems unable to give up       her sexual relationship with him. The analysis of her ambivalent       character is further complicated by the control that Aphrodite       exercises over her. One general rule, however, should be kept       in mind with regard to divine influence on human behavior: the       gods tend to influence characters to act in a way consistent       with their personalities. For example, the close relationship       of Aphrodite, the goddess of sexual love, with Paris and Helen,       is probably an indication that sexual desire is a predominant       drive in their psychological make-up. Conversely, Aphrodite never       exerts influence on Hektor, whose personality makes him primarily       a fighter rather than a lover.
As you read the Iliad,       make note of the evidence in the text which gives insight into       the personalities of important characters. The better you understand       the characters of the Iliad, the better you will understand       their actions. One note of warning: characters in a literary       work are not real human beings, but have been created by the       author to suit the needs of the story. Always keep this in mind       in character analysis.
Irony is a frequently       used device in literature, which can be employed in various ways.       One kind of irony is evident when literary characters in word       or deed make assumptions which the reader or audience know to       be false or say things which the characters cannot know the significance       of till later in the work. This kind of irony is often referred       to as "dramatic irony", which is so called because       of its frequent use in drama, but this term is also loosely applied       to the same phenomenon in narrative works like the Iliad.       Dramatic irony underlines the frustration suffered by central       characters in literature in the pursuit of their own happiness.       A classic example of dramatic irony occurs in Sophocles's       play Oedipus the King, in which the hero Oedipus       curses the killer of his predecessor in the kingship, not knowing       that he himself is the murderer. Watch out for examples of dramatic       irony in the Iliad; they are important for a proper understanding       of the poem.
A simile is a comparison       of two unlike things introduced by "like" or "as".       For example, Menelaos is compared to a wild beast because of       his eagerness to find Paris, who had been rescued by Aphrodite:       "Menelaos was wandering through the throng like a wild beast..."       (3.449). The basic purpose of this or any simile is to present       a word-picture which will make the reader experience in a more       vivid way what is being described. In the above example Menelaos's       movement in search of Paris is brought to life by the picture       of a wild beast, which suggests the frantic agitation of a man       who has been frustrated in his desire for revenge. The simile       is an important feature of Homer's style. He uses both short       similes like the one above and extended ones which became a standard       feature of the epic tradition after Homer. The first 35 lines       of Book 3 contain four extended similes.
Akin to the simile       is a figure of speech called a metaphor, a comparison between       two different things without the use of "like"       or "as". The simile describing Menelaos stated that       he was "like a wild beast". That simile could be stated       as a metaphor: "Menelaos is a wild beast". This, of       course, does not mean that Menelaos is literally a wild beast,       but that at this time he shares some characteristics with a wild       beast. Metaphors are not as common in the Iliad as similes,       but they do occur as in the formulaic phrase, "winged words"       (1.201). Obviously, words do not have wings, birds do. But words       do fly out of the mouth like birds, and once they have been said,       they are as hard to take back as birds are to capture.
Book 3
What contrast       is suggested by the description of the Trojans and the Achaians       in 1-9? by the description of Menelaos and Alexandros (Paris)       (15-37)? Why is Hektor upset by Paris's behavior (38-57)? What       difference does Paris see between himself and Hektor (59-66)?       What proposal does Paris make (67-75)? What is Helen doing when       she first appears in the narrative (125-127)? What is the symbolic       significance of her action? Why is Helen summoned by Iris       (130-138)? How does Homer depict Helen's beauty (156-160)? What       does Helen do for Priam (161-242)? Do you find anything strange       in the questions asked of Helen by Priam at this point in the       war (the tenth year)? What purpose does the information given       by Helen serve in the Iliad? What literary device is Homer       employing in 236-244?
What are the terms       of the duel (281-291)? What crime of Paris does Menelaos mention       in his prayer to Zeus (351-354)? What does Aphrodite's intervention       prevent (373-382)? Why does Aphrodite want Helen to go to Paris's       chamber (390-394)? What is Helen's reaction to the goddess's       invitation (399-412)? What threat does Aphrodite make to Helen       (414-417)? What criticism does Helen make of Paris (428-436)?       What is Paris's reaction to this criticism (438-446)? Helen's       actions in this scene are obviously inconsistent with her feelings.       What is the reason for her inconsistency?
What purpose does       book 3 serve? Does it advance the story begun in book 1 at all?       Explain your answer.
Homer often gives       his audience hints about what is going to happen later in the       story. This technique is called foreshadowing and conveys a sense       of the inevitability of important events. An example of foreshadowing       occurs in book 6 when Hektor leaves Andromache       to return to battle while her handmaidens mourn for him as if       he were already dead (500-502). Note also Hektor's pessimism       which he expresses to Andromache (447-465). This foreshadowing       prepares us for Hektor's death in book 22. Achilleus's approaching       death (which does not occur in the Iliad) is also foreshadowed       as early as book 1 by himself and his mother (352; 416).
The above examples       are only the most obvious instances of foreshadowing in the Iliad.       Try to find other more subtle instances of anticipation of future       events.
Book 6
Book six       begins with the deaths of minor figures on the Trojan side, many       of whom Homer brings briefly to life with a few words before       they are killed. What is the intended effect of Homer's description       of Axylos (12-15)? Evaluate the words and actions of Agamemnon       in the case of Adrestos in the light of Homeric morality (44-60).
What order does Helenos       give to Hektor (86-95)? What is unusual about this order? Why       does Diomedes (the son of Tydeus) ask Glaukos to identify himself       (123-143)? What comment does Glaukos's simile in 146-150 make       on humanity? The story which Glaukos tells about his grandfather       Bellerophontes has little or no connection with the plot, but       has an interest of its own as a heroic tale. The typically loose       organization of the epic form easily accommodates such a digression,       which would be intolerable in a smaller and more tightly structured       form like drama. What discovery does Diomedes       make when Glaukos mentions his grandfather (215-231)? What is       the result of Diomedes's discovery (232-236)?
After he delivers       Helenos's message to his mother Hekabe,       what does Hektor tell her he intends to do (280)? What is Hektor's       attitude toward Paris (281-285)? What is Athene's reaction to       the prayers and gift of the Trojan women (311)? What literary       device is Homer employing here? Explain your answer.
What does Hektor       encourage Paris to do (326-331)? How does Paris react to Hektor's       words (333-341)? What is Helen's view of herself and Paris (343-353)?       Where does Hektor go next (365)? What does Andromache fear (405-410)?       Note carefully Andromache's story about the death of her father       at the hands of Achilleus (414-428). It is a foreshadowing of       Achilleus's behavior in the last book of the Iliad. What       does Andromache think is most notable about Achilleus's conduct       with regard to her father? What request does Andromache make       of Hektor (431-434)? In Hektor's mind what prevents him from       doing what his wife asks (440-446)? What does Hektor foresee       for the Trojans and his wife (447-465)? What is the intended       effect of the laughter of Hektor and Andromache at their son's       terror in the context this sorrow-filled situation (466-471)?       What hopes does Hektor have for his son (476-481)? What literary       device is evident in this expression of Hektor's hopes? What       is Hektor's state of mind as he leaves his family (486-493)?       What literary device is evident in 500? What do we learn about       Hektor's character from his meetings with Hekabe, Paris, Helen       and Andromache?
What comment does       the simile in 506-511 make on the character of Paris? What are       Hektor's feelings about Paris (521-525)?
What purpose does       book 6 serve? Does it advance the story begun in book 1 at all?       Explain your answer.
Book 9
How are the       Achaians doing in the war at this point in the story (1-8)? Note       the capitalization of the first letters of Panic and Terror (2;       see Hate in 11.4). The reason for this is that these two human       emotions are personified as minor divinities by Homer. What recommendation       does Agamemnon make to the Achaians (17-28)? What criticism does       Diomedes make of Agamemnon (38-39)? What is Diomedes's attitude       with regard to the war (45-49)? What advice does Nestor give       to Agamemnon (96-113)? How does Agamemnon react to this advice       (115-161)? What Achaians does Nestor suggest should go to Achilleus       (168-170)? Why doesn't Agamemnon go himself?
What is Achilleus       doing when these men arrive at his hut (186-189)? How does Achilleus       behave toward them (197-204)? What is Patroklos's role in this       scene (201-220)? Then each ambassador delivers a speech which       is in turn answered by Achilleus. You no doubt have noted that       Homer frequently employs speeches in his narrative. Throughout       ancient times speech-making was the primary means of mass communication.       Writing did exist, but without a printing press, publication       of written material was very limited. Thus it is natural that       speeches are prominent in the Iliad. The speeches also       give a lively dramatic quality to the poem. This quality often       leads students to make the mistake of calling the Iliad a       play, that is, a dramatic performance in which actors impersonate       characters, when it is really a narrative poem, that is, a genre       in which a story teller or narrator relates the whole story.       Odysseus       is spokesman for Agamemnon and therefore speaks first because       of his rhetorical skills (see 3.216-223). Although Odysseus repeats       word for word most of Agamemnon's earlier speech (115-161), he       makes purposeful additions and omissions. Read Odysseus's speech       (225-306) carefully and identify these additions and omissions.       Explain the reason for each addition and omission.
To whom do you think       Achilleus is referring in 312-313? Achilleus then presents his       reasons for rejecting Agamemnon's offer (315-420). Briefly summarize       these reasons. Do you find them convincing? Explain your answer.       What does Achilleus say he will do now that he has refused to       accept the gifts (357-363; 426-429)?
The speech of Phoinix       is divided into three sections: Phoinix's relationships with       his father, Peleus and Achilleus (447-495), the parable of the       prayers (502-512), and the example of Meleagros (529-599). What       effect does Phoinix hope lines 485-496 will have on Achilleus?       What is Phoinix's basic message to Achilleus (496-501)? Phoinix's       story of the spirits of Prayer is a parable: a story illustrating       a moral lesson. In this story what we would regard as psychological       phenomena internal to a human being are personified as minor       divinities. Ruin represents the tendency to give offense to others       and the spirit of prayers, the desire to make amends by asking       forgiveness. What point does this parable make? The story of       Meleagros is an instance of the technique commonly used by Homeric       characters of giving a mythological example to make an argument       more persuasive. Although this story is long and detailed, its       essential message is clear and simple. What is this message (600-605)?       What is Achilleus's response to Phoinix's speech (607-619)?
What is the main       point of Aias's       brief speech (624-642)? What is Achilleus's response to this       speech (644-655)? What does Odysseus report to Agamemnon (677-692)?       Is Odysseus's report entirely accurate? Explain your answer.       What is Diomedes's reaction to this report (697-709)?
Describe Achilleus's       state of mind in book 9. Does he really believe everything he       says to Odysseus? Explain your answer.
Book 11
What purpose       does the wounding of Agamemnon, Diomedes, Odysseus and Eurypylos       serve at this point in the story (1-590)? What significance do       the disasters suffered by the Achaians have for Achilleus (608-609)?       What do lines 598-614 say about Achilleus's feelings with regard       to the war and the Achaians? What literary device is evident       in 603? What order does Achilleus give to Patroklos       (610-614)?
How is Nestor's speech       (655-802; cf. 1.254-284) typical of him? What suggestion does       Nestor make to Patroklos (791-802)? What do you think is the       effect of Eurypylos's words (822-835) on Patroklos?
Book 16
Why does       Patroklos mention the wounding of the Achaian chieftains to Achilleus       (23-29)? Explain the meaning of the metaphors of the sea and       rocks in 34-35. What request does Patroklos make of Achilleus       and what does he hope to accomplish, if Achilleus consents (38-45)?       Read 49-63 carefully. Explain why Achilleus agrees to Patroklos's       request. What warning does Achilleus give to Patroklos (87-96)?       Why does Achilleus give this warning? What frustration does Achilleus's       prayer to the gods reveal (97-100)?
What emergency critical       to the fortunes of the Achaians arises (112-124)? After the formulaic       scene of Patroklos's arming (130-144), Achilleus prepares his       men the Myrmidons       for battle. Homer then presents a catalogue of the Myrmidons       (168-197). Catalogue poetry is an important feature of the epic.       In book two there is an elaborate catalogue of the Achaians at       Troy and a smaller one of the Trojans. In book 18 there is also       a catalogue of the daughters of Nereus who are mourning the death       of Patroklos (39-49). What comment do the similes in 156-163       and 259-265) make on the character of the Myrmidons? What was       their attitude with regard to Achilleus's withdrawal from the       war (200-209)? What prayer does Achilleus make to Zeus (241-248)?       What literary device is evident in 249-252?
Fate in the Iliad       is not a force which predetermines all human actions. Fate       primarily refers to ends, like the end of a man's life or of       a city such as Troy. These ends are governed by fate and cannot       be avoided. The relationship of the gods to fate is an issue       in the conversation between Zeus and Hera. What action does Zeus       consider in 435-438? What warning does Hera give to Zeus (440-449)?       Is fate the same as the will of the gods? What control do the       gods have over fate? What does Zeus's sorrow for Sarpedon's death       add to the account of his son's death (459-461)?
What is Patroklos's       first concern after killing Sarpedon (558-561)? What is the effect       of the extended simile describing the battle over Sarpedon's       armor (641-643)? What request does Zeus make of Apollo (667-675)?       In what sense is Patroklos responsible for his own death (684-691;705;786-787)?       What warning does Apollo give to Patroklos (707-709)? What aid       does Apollo give to Hektor (715-725)? How is the simile in 752-753       an example of foreshadowing? How is Patroklos's death accomplished       (791-821)? Why does Homer have Patroklos killed in this manner?       What is the significance of Achilleus's helmet which is struck       off Patroklos's head and is picked up and worn by Hektor (796-800)?       What prediction does the dying Patroklos make to Hektor (844-854)?       What is Hektor's reaction to this prophecy (859-861)?
Book 18
How does       Achilleus react to the news of Patroklos's death (22-34)? What       figure of speech is employed in 22? What ironical fact does Thetis       point out to Achilleus (72-77)? Explain the irony of her statement.       What is Achilleus determined to do as a result of Patroklos's       death (90-93)? What does this action entail for Achilleus (95-96)?       How does Achilleus view his anger which had led him to withdraw       from the war (98-126)? What must Thetis do before Achilleus can       return to battle (130-137)? What message does Hera send to Achilleus       (197-201)? How does Achilleus drive back the Trojans (203-231)?       What does Achilleus's rout of the Trojans enable the Achaians       to do (231-238)? What help does Hera provide (239-242)?
Summarize briefly       Poulydamas's speech to the Trojans (254-283). What is Hektor's       reaction to this advice (285-309)? Is Hektor correct when he       says that Zeus's intention in allowing him to drive the Achaians       back to their ships was to give him glory (293-295; see 1.407-410)?       Explain your answer. What comment does Homer make on the Trojan       reaction to the speeches of Poulydamas and Hektor (312-313)?       What promise does Achilleus make to the body of Patroklos (333-342)?
Explain Zeus's sarcasm       to Hera in 357-359. How does Hera reply (361-367)? What obligation       does Hephaistos owe to Thetis (394-409)? What request does Thetis       make of Hephaistos (457-461)? How does Hephaistos react to this       request (463-467)? What connections with the story of the Iliad       do the pictures engraved on the shield suggest to you?
When a series of       related images appears in a literary work, the reader should       be alert to the possibility that the author is expressing something       important about his story and/or characters through the pattern       of his imagery.14 The Iliad as a whole and,       in particular, Book 22 give evidence of patterns of imagery which       add significance to the narrative.
14Imagery       is the employment of images (word pictures) in a given passage       of a literary work, a whole work, or a group of works.
As Cedric Whitman       in his book, Homer and the Heroic Tradition (New York,       1965, 128-147), has shown, there is a network of fire imagery,       which extends throughout the Iliad and is connected with       heroism, especially that of Achilleus. The fire imagery of book       22 is a continuation of the image which accompanies Achilleus's       appearance in book 18 at the ditch to frighten the Trojans with       his war cry and is designed to strengthen the impression of Achilleus's       destructive power. There Athene causes a flame to issue forth       from a cloud around Achilleus's head. This flame is in turn compared       to a flare and signal fires originating from a besieged city       (207-213). The image of the besieged city is a foreshadowing       of what the city of Troy will soon experience when Achilleus       kills its champion Hektor. Also, the armor which is made for       Achilleus later in book 18 is created by Hephaistos, the god       of fire, and on the shield are depicted images associated with       fire: sun, moon, and stars. In book 22 the fiery brightness of       Achilleus's armor is compared to the destructive star Orion's       Dog (Sirius), which rises in late summer when, as the ancients       believed, oppressive heat caused disease (26-31) and later Achilleus's       spear is likened to the evening star Hesper, which seems to gleam       especially brightly because of the darkening sky (317-318).
In book 22 there       are many other related images which contribute important significance       to the narrative. Take careful note of this imagery and its meaning       as you read this book.
The word 'tragedy'       primarily used of a dramatic work, that is, a play in which a       central character called a tragic protagonist or hero suffers       some serious misfortune which is not accidental and therefore       meaningless, but is significant in that the misfortune is logically       connected with the hero's actions. 'Tragedy' and its adjective       'tragic', however, can be used of any literary work containing       a protagonist whose actions lead to disaster for himself and       others (e.g., the Iliad).
In tragic literature,       the actions of the protagonist, no matter how well-intentioned,       lead to disaster. In the Iliad, a sense of the futility       of human action is conveyed by the use of dramatic irony, especially       when Homer depicts his characters unknowingly doing things which       lead them to their own doom and contrasts their ignorance with       the gods' knowledge of their fate. In reading the Iliad note       carefully how the actions of Achilleus and Hektor contribute       to their own misfortunes and exactly when they become aware of       the consequence of their actions.15
15More       will be said on the nature of tragedy in the introduction       to Greek Tragedy.
Book 22
What does       Apollo point out to Achilleus about his pursuit of the god (7-13)?       What is Achilleus's reply (15-20)? What does the Orion's Dog       simile emphasize about Achilleus (26-31)? Why does Priam urge       Hektor not to fight Achilleus (38-76)? What is Hekabe's reason       for making the same request (82-89)? What are Hektor's feelings       about fighting Achilleus (99-110)? What does Hektor think about       the possibility of making peace with Achilleus (111-130)?
What is Hektor's       reaction to Achilleus's approach (136-137)? Note carefully the       images applied to Achilleus and Hektor in 139-142, 189-192, 262-264,       and 308-310. How are these images related and what comment do       they make upon these two heroes and the situation in which they       find themselves? Explain what the images of the race and dream       contribute to the narrative (159-164;199-201). Why does Homer       interrupt his account of the chase to describe the two springs(147-156)?       What is the meaning of "Father" Zeus's balancing of       the golden scales (209-213)? How does Athene help Achilleus (224-246;276-277;293-303)?       What request does Hektor twice make of Achilleus (254-259;338-343)?       How does Achilleus answer him on both occasions (261-272; 345-354)?       What does the dying Hektor predict to Achilleus (356-360)? What       is Achilleus's reaction to this prediction (365-366)?
How do the Achaians       and Achilleus treat Hektor's body (367-371;396-404)? What comment       does the simile in 410-411 make on Hektor's death? What does       Priam decide he must do (418-422)? What did Hektor mean to Hekabe       and the other Trojans (431-436)? Why does Homer take time to       describe Andromache's headdress when she faints at her discovery       of Hektor's death (466-472)? What effect will Hektor's death       have on Astyanax (489-514)?
Book 24
Describe       Achilleus's psychological state in the beginning of the book       (1-22). Why do Hera and Athene ("the girl of the grey eyes")       hate Priam and his people (25-30)? How is Achilleus's treatment       of Hektor's corpse viewed by the gods in general (23-24)? by       Apollo (33-54)? by Hera (56-63)? What role does Iris       play in 77-88 and in 159-187 (as in 18.166-167)? What request       does Zeus make of Thetis (104-119)? How has Achilleus been living       since Patroklos's death (128-131)? What is Achilleus's reaction       to Zeus's message (139-140)?
What message does       Zeus give to Iris to deliver to Priam (144-152)? What prediction       does Zeus make about Achilleus's reaction to Priam's supplication       (158)? In what condition does Iris find Priam (162-165)? What       does Hekabe think of Priam's intention to go to Achilleus (201-216)?       How does Priam answer Hekabe's objections (218-227)? How does       Priam feel about his surviving sons (239-264)? What sign does       Priam ask of Zeus (308-313)? How does Zeus answer his prayer       (314-321)? What task does Zeus assign to Hermes (334-338)? Who       does Hermes (Argeiphontes) pretend to be (390-400)? Where and       in what condition is Hektor's body (411-423)?
What is the significance       of the fact that Achilleus has resumed eating and drinking (475-476)?       What does Priam do first when he enters Achilleus's dwelling       (478-480)? What ritual act is Priam performing with these gestures?       What is the irony of his kissing Achilleus's hands (478-480)?       What arguments does Priam use to persuade Achilleus to return       the body (486-506)? How does Achilleus react to Priam's acts       and words (507-524)? According to Achilleus, what is the basic       difference between divine and human life (525-526)? What is the       moral of Achilleus's story of the two urns (527-533)? How does       the experience of Peleus illustrate this moral (534-541)? What       is Achilleus's reaction to Priam's impatience (560-570)?
In your opinion,       why does Achilleus give Hektor's body back to Priam? Is it only       because Zeus so ordered? Explain your answer. Why does Achilleus       tell Priam the story of Niobe       (601-620)? What connections can you find between the experiences       of Niobe and Priam? How do Achilleus and Priam feel about each       other (629-632)? What additional favor does Achilleus grant Priam       (656-658)?
Why does Hermes urge       Priam to leave Achilleus's dwelling (683-688)?
What future does       Andromache foresee for herself and her son (725-739)? What view       of Hektor does Helen present (762-775)? Why does the poem end       with the burial of Hektor? Do you find this an appropriate ending       to the poem? Explain your answer.

-=-=-TITLE:  <b>Iliad</b> Study Guide | GradeSaver
-=-=-SNIPPET:  Iliad study guide contains a biography of Homer, literature essays, a complete e-ntext, quiz questions, major themes, characters, and a full summary and analysis.
-=-=-TEXT: Consisting of 15,693 lines of verse, the Iliad has been hailed as the greatest epic of Western civilization. Although we know little about the time period when it was composed and still less about the epic's composer, the Iliad's influence on subsequent generations of poets and writers is incalculable. The great Aeschylus claimed that his plays consisted only of the scraps left over from Homer; centuries later, Virgil, writing a founding myth centuries later for the great Roman Empire, took Homer as his inspiration and model. The influence of Homer is felt down through the centuries, in Dante and Chaucer, Shakespeare and Milton; such is his power that men who read no word of Greek and who had no access to translations spoke of Homer and his epics with deep reverence. After 2,700 years, it remains unsurpassed as the West's greatest war story.
The Iliad has its basis in the rich mythology of Greece. Knowledge of mythology can be a hindrance as well as an aid for the modern reader approaching the Iliad, because the myths underwent changes and variations throughout the centuries before and after Homer. Readers must take care to pay attention to the specifics of Homer's story, without superimposing myths gathered from elsewhere. Popularly known is the story of Achilles' invulnerability, with the fatal exception of his heel. This myth has no place in the Iliad: Achilles is as mortal as everyone else, and Homer explicitly tells us that this is the case. He does not owe his strength to rituals by the River Styx performed by his mother during his infancy, and there is no mention of a vulnerable heel. The poem does not deal with the sack of Troy, or with the famous episode of the Trojan horse, although the horse is alluded to in the Odyssey. Another myth holds that Helen's father, Tyndareus, feared that Helen's beauty would bring her suitors to war. To prevent war all across Greece, he made the suitors all swear to stand by the man chosen to be Helen's husband in the event that she should be abducted. There is no mention of this story anywhere in the Iliad. And another well-known story tells us that the Achaean war fleet gathered at Aulis and could not sail because of the wrath of the goddess Artemis. To appease the goddess, Agamemnon sacrificed his own daughter, Iphigenia. Again, the myth is not part of Homer's story. He either lived before these myths evolved or he did not find them suitable for his purposes.
Archeological evidence suggests that there was a great city near the Hellespont, on the site traditionally ascribed to Troy. It was destroyed by war sometime around the thirteenth century BCE. The Iliad probably has some basis in fact; there may have been a massive campaign by Greek-speaking peoples against a great city on the coast of Asia Minor. Homer himself was a Greek living in one of the colonies of Asia Minor, but his epics deal with a time when no Greek lived in Asia. Given the evidence, it seems safe to say that his work attempts to reconstruct stories from a past that was already distant. In the time before written history, the passage of a few centuries made accurate recall of historical events all but impossible. Homer's Iliad is therefore more myth than history, although many ancient Greeks understood his epics as being in some way factual. The heroes of the Iliad were very real to the Greeks, holding a place in their history as well as their literature and religion. During the time of Alexander the Great, Greeks recognized a structure in Asia Minor as the burial mound of Achilles and Patroclus, and families often traced their ancestry back to heroes in the Iliad.
This study guide uses the Richard Lattimore translation when referring to specific passages. However, the names used are from the Robert Fagles translation, since the Fagles version uses the name forms that are most familiar to the modern English-speaking reader.

FibroGen, Inc. (FibroGen) is a research-based biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to treat unmet medical needs. The Company focuses in the areas of fibrosis and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) biology. FibroGen’s products include Roxadustat (FG-4592), which is an oral small molecule inhibitor of HIF prolyl hydroxylases (HIF-PHs), in Phase III clinical development for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and FG-3019, which is a monoclonal antibody in Phase II clinical development for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pancreatic cancer and liver fibrosis. The Company’s subsidiaries include FibroGen Europe Oy (FibroGen Europe) and FibroGen China Anemia Holdings, Ltd. (FibroGen China). 
Roxadustat is the HIF-PH inhibitor in Phase III clinical development, which acts by stimulating the body’s natural pathway of erythropoiesis, or red blood cell produc tion. Roxadustat represents a new paradigm for the treatment of anemia in CKD patients and offers injectable erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs). 1,449 subjects have participated in 26 completed Phase I and II clinical studies for roxadustat in North America, Europe and Asia. The Company, along with its collaboration partners, Astellas Pharma Inc., (Astellas) and AstraZeneca AB,(AstraZeneca), has designed a global Phase III program to support regulatory approval of roxadustat in both NDD-CKD and DD-CKD patients in multiple geographies. 
FG-3019 is the Company’s fully-human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the activity of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a critical common element in the progression of fibrosis and associated diseases. In Phase II IPF clinical studies, FG-3019 demonstrated the stabilization of disease and, in human studies, reversal of lung fibrosis in some patients. In an open-label Phase II pancreatic cancer study of FG-3019 plus gemcitabine and erlotinib, FG-3019 demonstrated a dose-depen! dent improvement in one year survival rate. In 10 Phase I and Phase II clinical studies of FG-3019 to date involving over 340 subjects, FG-3019 has been tolerated across a range of doses studied, and there have been no dose-limiting toxicities observed as of November 13, 2014. 
The Company competes with Threshold Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc., Gilead Sciences, Inc., Celgene Corporation, Janssen Biotech, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Inc., Sanofi, Novartis and Biogen Idec.

Recent IPO FibroGen Inc (NASDAQ: FGEN) surged 22.96% today, reportedly after the journal Hepatology published the results of a workshop between the FDA and the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) which laid out criteria for a phase three study of a treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) – meaning its worth taking a closer look at the stock along with the performance of potential small cap or mid cap liver disease stock peers like Conatus Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: CNAT), Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: ICPT) and Raptor Pharmaceutical Corp (NASDAQ: RPTP) which rose 24.35%, 10.98% and 2.02%, respectively. According to Investors Business Daily, NASH (the more serious version of fatty liver disease) is potentially an enormous market with about 6 million US patients but the lack of previous treatments had left it unclear how the FDA would measure success against the disease while FibroGen Inc doesn’t yet have a NASH human trial in the works, it has said it hopes to start one for its lead candidate FG-3019 (its in mid-stage trials for pulmonary fibrosis and liver fibrosis due to hepatitis B infection).

I’ve never been a big fan of STZ stock, as the economics of the wine business are much less attractive than those of beer and spirits. Wineries have far less brand value than beer brewers and liquor distillers and tend to have lower margins. In February of last year, I recommended that readers steer clear of STZ stock and instead focus on Dutch megabrewer Heineken (HEINY).

But what happens when you fill out an application to rent an apartment? Or apply for life insurance? Or try to write a check? Is anyone checking up on you then? The answer may be yes. In all those cases, a business might be pulling a specialty report that could determine whether you get the apartment, the life insurance policy or the privilege of handing over one of your super-cute Hello Kitty checks. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has a comprehensive list of all the major organizations maintaining files on you. You might want to see what they know. 1. Medical Reports Your doctor may not be the only person who has a medical file on you. Several companies also maintain reports that could contain bits of your medical information. The most commonly used medical report may be the one from MIB, an organization previously known as the Medical Information Bureau. MIB reports are used by insurance companies offering individually underwritten life, health, critical illness, disability and long-term-care insurance products.

GoPro (GPRO) rose 5.7% on positive comments from J.P. Morgan analyst Paul Coster ahead of the J.P. Morgan Tech Forum at the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Tuesday. [By WWW.DAILYFINANCE.COM] 
gopro.com If a thrill-seeking mountain biker wants to take on some choppy terrain, it might not be a bad idea to ride GoPro’s (GPRO) stock chart. One of the market’s most volatile stocks is the maker of wearable cameras that extreme sporting enthusiasts — like our mountain biker here — don to record their feats of fancy. It’s been a tale of two quarters for GoPro in its first six months as a public company. GoPro went public at $24 in late June, soaring in subsequent weeks. It peaked in early October, more than quadrupling to hit $98.47. It has gone on to shed more than 40 percent of its value. The wild swings aren’t a surprise. GoPro went public with plenty of hype this summer, and valuation concerns were bound to come up after it roared out of the gate. Why was GoPro so hot six months ago? Why has it been so cold this quarter? Let’s take a look at the two sides of the GoPro mania. Meet the Hot IPO of 2014 It’s easy to see why investors gravitated toward GoPro. We’ve all seen those breathtaking helmet-mounted high-def videos of skateboarders, skiers and hang gliders, and GoPro is the wearable camera of choice for adrenaline junkies like these. GoPro came to market with the speed of some of its action videos. Revenue more than doubled in 2012, and nearly did so again in 2013 when its top line soared 87 percent to hit $985.7 million. Earnings and operating profits were also on a tear. Another thing that helped GoPro was that it more than lived up to the hype. It posted better-than-expected earnings in its first two quarterly reports as a public company, and first impressions for Wall Street debutantes linger. Investors sometimes stay away from hardware plays, especially in a cutthroat market like video cameras. However, GoPro made it clear at the time of its IPO that its grander goal was to become a media company. It wanted to tap into the growing content created by GoPro users to create a social video platform of its own. It went on to hire Guggenheim [By WWW.DAILYFINANCE.COM] 
www.gopro.com Now that it’s nearly over, we can definitively say that 2014 has been one of the best years for initial public stock offerings in history. In terms of proceeds raised from IPOs, 2014 will challenge or even exceed the year 2000. Which is saying something: That was the height of the dot.com frenzy, when seemingly every new company with a website felt compelled to list on the stock exchange. As can be expected of a busy IPO year, some of 2014′s new stock market titles have been runaway hits soaring above their issue price, while others have belly-flopped. Since we’re heading into the most optimistic time of the year, we’ll shine a light on the three best performers. In order of stock price appreciation, they are: GoPro (GPRO) 2014′s current IPO front-runner is this company, maker of the popular action photography camera — the one that’s usually responsible for those hairy point-of-view videos posted on Facebook (FB) and other online sharing sites. GoPro’s stock hit the market at the end of June priced at $24, and as if this writing it now stands at $70.72 for a muscular 195 percent total return. Although that’s impressive, it should be noted that the current price is quite a bit lower than the stock’s high of nearly $94, which it touched in early October. But then the camera was effectively blamed for the horrific accident that befell Formula One racing star Michael Schumacher — although the journalist making the allegation later recanted — and the shares cratered. The stock recovered after the company reported strong third-quarter earnings, and all seemed well again… until GoPro decided to float a secondary issue of stock. It’ll sell 10.3 million fresh shares on the market, adding to the nearly 126 million currently outstanding. When secondary share issues are announced, a company’s stock often takes a hit, since investors aren’t too crazy about their existing stakes being diluted. Regardless, on a fundamental basis GoPro is a popular, if [By Jonas Elmerraji] 
First up is Wall Street darling GoPro (GPRO), a name that’s been on a tear since it had its IPO in the mid-summer — shares of the action camera maker are up 144% since their first print. But despite the post-IPO buying frenzy, GoPro is starting to look “toppy” this fall. Here’s how to trade it… 
GoPro is currently forming a descending triangle pattern, a bearish price setup that’s formed by horizontal support down at $65, and downtrending resistance above shares. Basically, as GPRO bounces in between those two technically important price levels, it’s getting squeezed closer to a breakdown below our $65 price floor. When that happens, we’ve got our sell signal. 
The nail isn’t in the coffin quite yet in GPRO — if shares can manage to break out of their descending triangle pattern to the topside, the bearish implications are over (in fact, an aborted bearish pattern is often a stronger buy signal than an outright bullish one). But the descending triangle that’s forming as this stock’s first real price pattern is a very noticeable red flag for buyers. I’d be a seller on a violation of $65 support.

French telecom operator Orange SA (NYSE: ORAN ) isn’t anything like a high-end Swiss watch. In fact, its dividend history is enough to give heartburn to many income investors: [By Barel Karsan] 
About a year ago, Orange (ORAN) was brought up on this site as a potential value investment. (Back then, we knew it as France Telecom (FTE).) Sentiment was in the toilet. A weak European economy combined with new regulations and an upstart competitor scared investors away, resulting in price to free cash flow ratios in the single digits. But these are exactly the conditions under which investors should be buying. When temporary issues (and there were a trifecta here!) affect a historically profitable business in an industry with barriers to entry, it can create a buying opportunity if investors are running scared. That appears to have been what happened here. The regulatory issues eased up as did the competitive environment, and shares of Orange have risen 60% to what I would consider a more appropriate valuation. Some of the comments I received when I wrote the article last year include: “FTE will end, but I think it has more than enough strength to limp on for another decade at least, dragging on yield hungry investors that don’t know any better.”“Lets not look at the horrible French economy”“worsening unemployment”“government that loves to socialize, ruin their private businesses”“It’s been in decline year after year after year.” Such macro-economic, backward-looking forecasts have no place in value investing! Go against the crowd.Disclosure: No position [By Patricio Kehoe] rance, the company has expanded its services onto 32 other countries, serving a total of 236 million customers. Hence, it has become one of the world’s largest telecommunications carriers and the third largest wireless operator in Europe. 
The firm provides local phone, domestic and international long distance, wireless data communications, Internet access, multimedia, broadcast and cable TV services. Its business arm, Orange Business Services, accounts for 15.9% of the company’s sales and is one of the leading providers of communications services to multinational companies. 
A Healthy Management 
In order to counter the aggressive pricing strategy from wireless new entrant Iliad SA (ILD) in France, Orange was forced to reduce prices. Thus, the firm has continued to add wireless subscribers but at a lower average revenue per user, mainly through its low-end Sosh brand. 
Further, its existing contract base keeps rolling into lower priced plans. As a result, the company’s revenue has plunged, in spite of which the firm has managed to improve its bottom line year over year in 2013. 
Management’s efficiency is also evidenced by its decision to reduce its non-core assets in order to concentrate on its most profitable businesses. Consequently, almost nine months after its initial tender, Orange divested its Dominican unit to Luxemburg-based Altice SA (ATC) for $1.4 billion last week. 
The news boosted its stock price, which climbed 2.31% on the NYSE last Wednesday. This operation provides the company with significant cash volume to reduce its debt burden and invest in Europe and other emerging markets.

-=-=-TITLE:  <b>Iliad</b> offers $15B in cash for 56.6% of T-Mobile, at $33 per share
-=-=-SNIPPET:  Jul 31, 2014 ... French telecoms operator Iliad has made a $15 billion bid to purchase more than nhalf of T-Mobile USA, countering an earlier offer by Sprint.
-=-=-TEXT:   French telecoms operator Iliad has made a $15 billion cash offer to purchase 56.6 percent of  T-Mobile USA , the No. 4 U.S. mobile provider, an unexpected move that counters an earlier merger proposal by Sprint .   
  T-Mobile confirmed to CNBC that it received a proposal from Iliad, but said it had no further comment on the matter at this time. 
  Iliad submitted the bid to T-Mobile's board of directors and said it is working with leading international banks to secure financing for the deal.  
  "The U.S. mobile market is large and attractive," Iliad  said in a statement. " T-Mobile US has successfully  established a disruptive position, which in many ways, is similar to the one Iliad has  built in France."

  The company said it values the remaining 43.4 percent of company at $40.5 per share on the basis of $10 billion of synergies to the benefit of the T-Mobile U.S. shareholders.  
  Dow Jones first reported the news, citing a an unnamed source who said Iliad views the bid as a "one-time opportunity to enter the world's-largest telecoms market." 
Iliad has disrupted the French mobile and broadband market over the past few years with its ultra-cheap subscriber  plans.  
  Japan's SoftBank, which controls Sprint, and T-Mobile owner Deutsche Telekom AG had reportedly agreed to broad terms of a merger between the two firms, under which Sprint would pay around $40 per share for T-Mobile, valuing the smaller rival at nearly $32 billion, according to Reuters, who said the deal was expected to occur sometime after September. 
  S&P Capital IQ's  Angelo Zino has a hold recommendation on T-Mobile and he believes Sprint can top the  Iliad's  offer, but says a merger of the two companies would endure intense scrutiny.  
  "We believe Sprint remains highly interested in acquiring [T-Mobile] and can provide a more superior offer to its shareholders," Zino said, adding that a potential offer from Sprint would likely face "significant regulatory hurdles as opposed to Iliad's."    
  Sprint shares dropped as much as 8 percent after the announcement, while T-Mobile shares rose more than 7 percent after being halted earlier.  
  "The opportunity for a transaction that brings capital and spectrum would be highly beneficial,'' T-Mobile CEO John Legere told CNBC earlier Thursday. "The opportunity to bring Sprint and T-Mobile together is one. But there are many different ways to to this and we will consider all of them." 
  During the second-quarter, T-Mobile added 1.5 million net customers in the and 102,000 net prepaid subscribers, compared with prepaid subscriber losses for the top four wireless carriers, according to Reuters.  
  Looking forward, the company raised its full year guidance and says it now expects to add between 3 million and 3.5 million postpaid customers in 2014.

-=-=-TITLE: Greek Mythological Canon - Naruto Forums
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: I agree with the basic outline said above me that attempting to establish a doctrine of linear canonicity to a medium of swift flexibility with the all-important details, integration of additional concepts with the constant influx of foreign cultures into the Greco-Roman cultural model (and even considering fairly substantial differences within Greco-Roman culture itself, with anywhere from Etruscan to Hellenistic influences) and a consistent climate of localisation, revisionism and general anti-canon approaches is exceedingly challenging, to say the least.
I guess you could begin by following Never's rough guideline on swarming together the major literary narratives of Early Antiquity which have survived to the modern day, but that's a minimal archaeological period of ~500 years (counting purely Ancient Greek and not 'classical' Roman, which adds at least another 150~200 years of information on top of that to filter through), along with the fact that there are a'plenty of 'missing-link' accounts and sources which are likely to never emerge that later extant works draw upon instead of earlier, also surviving sources, you're bound to discover even within the major sagas and epics that because they haven't all been derived from the same ~10 year period, there are a plethora of minor, possibly even major, discrepencies and inconsistencies emerging.
Quote: : Example: Heracles being powerscaled reaction wise to Hera's speed derived from a feat in the Iliad (done by our good moderator Kaiser).
Thanking you graciously, but that's definitely not mine
I know for a fact that someone did indeed calc the feat, but for the life of me cannot recall who.
The speed 'feat' I placed in a character profile for Heracles was a last-second dodge of a Zeus lightning bolt, thrown to halt an incoming battle between him and either Ares or Apollo, IIRC.

HOMER was a semi-legendary Greek poet from Ionia who the Greeks ascribed with the composition of their greatest epics : the Iliad and the Odyssey. The date of these works is disputed by modern scholars, but they are usually placed in the C8th or C7th BC.
Revised versions of these two Loeb volumes are still in print and available new from Amazon.com (click on image right for details). In addition to the translation  the book contains the source Greek texts, Murray and Wyatt's introduction and footnotes, and an index of proper names.
Some more recent translations of the Iliad and commentaries on the work appear in the booklist (right).
NOTE: I have quoted from the Lattimore translation on the biography pages of Theoi.com rather this older Loeb edition. 
[1] The wrath sing, goddess, of Peleus' son, Achilles, that destructive wrath which brought countless woes upon the Achaeans, and sent forth to Hades many valiant souls of heroes, and made them themselves spoil for dogs and every bird; thus the plan of Zeus came to fulfillment, from the time when first they parted in strife Atreus' son, king of men, and brilliant Achilles.
[8] Who then of the gods was it that brought these two together to contend? The son of Leto and Zeus; for he in anger against the king roused throughout the host an evil pestilence, and the people began to perish, because upon the priest Chryses the son of Atreus had wrought dishonour. For he had come to the swift ships of the Achaeans to free his daughter, bearing ransom past counting; and in his hands he held the wreaths of Apollo who strikes from afar, on a staff of gold; and he implored all the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus, the marshallers of the people: Sons of Atreus, and other well-greaved Achaeans, to you may the gods who have homes upon Olympus grant that you sack the city of Priam, and return safe to your homes; but my dear child release to me, and accept the ransom out of reverence for the son of Zeus, Apollo who strikes from afar.
[22] Then all the rest of the Achaeans shouted assent, to reverence the priest and accept the glorious ransom, yet the thing did not please the heart of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, but he sent him away harshly, and laid upon him a stern command: "Let me not find you, old man, by the hollow ships, either tarrying now or coming back later, lest your staff and the wreath of the god not protect you. Her I will not set free. Sooner shall old age come upon her in our house, in Argos, far from her native land, as she walks to and fro before the loom and serves my bed. But go, do not anger me, that you may return the safer."
[33] So he spoke, and the old man was seized with fear and obeyed his word. He went forth in silence along the shore of the loud-resounding sea, and earnestly then, when he had gone apart, the old man prayed to the lord Apollo, whom fair-haired Leto bore: "Hear me, god of the silver bow, who stand over Chryse and holy Cilla, and rule mightily over Tenedos, Sminthian god, if ever I roofed over a temple to your pleasing, or if ever I burned to you fat thigh-pieces of bulls and goats, fulfill this prayer for me: let the Danaans pay for my tears by your arrows."
[43] So he spoke in prayer, and Phoebus Apollo heard him. Down from the peaks of Olympus he strode, angered at heart, bearing on his shoulders his bow and covered quiver. The arrows rattled on the shoulders of the angry god as he moved, and his coming was like the night. Then he sat down apart from the ships and let fly an arrow: terrible was the twang of the silver bow. The mules he assailed first and the swift dogs, but then on the men themselves he let fly his stinging shafts, and struck; and constantly the pyres of the dead burned thick.
[53] For nine days the missiles of the god ranged among the host, but on the tenth Achilles called the people to assembly, for the goddess, white-armed Hera, had put it in his heart, since she pitied the Danaans, when she saw them dying. When they were assembled and gathered together, among them arose and spoke swift-footed Achilles: "Son of Atreus, now I think we shall return home, beaten back again, should we even escape death, if war and pestilence alike are to ravage the Achaeans. But come, let us ask some seer or priest, or some reader of dreams—for a dream too is from Zeus—who might say why Phoebus Apollo is so angry, whether he finds fault with a vow or a hecatomb; in hope that he may accept the savour of lambs and unblemished goats, and be willing to ward off the pestilence from us."
[68] When he had thus spoken he sat down, and among them arose Calchas son of Thestor, far the best of bird-diviners, who knew the things that were, and that were to be, and that had been before, and who had guided the ships of the Achaeans to Ilios by his own prophetic powers which Phoebus Apollo had bestowed upon him. He with good intent addressed the gathering, and spoke among them: "Achilles, dear to Zeus, you bid me declare the wrath of Apollo, the lord who strikes from afar. Therefore I will speak; but take thought and swear that you will readily defend me with word and with might of hand; for I think I shall anger a man who rules mightily over all the Argives, and whom the Achaeans obey. For mightier is a king, when he is angry at a lesser man. Even if he swallows down his wrath for that day, yet afterwards he cherishes resentment in his heart till he brings it to fulfillment. Say then, if you will keep me safe."
[84] In answer to him spoke swift-footed Achilles: "Take heart, and speak out whatever oracle you know; for by Apollo, dear to Zeus, to whom you, Calchas, pray when you reveal oracles to the Danaans, no one, while I live and have sight on the earth, shall lay heavy hands on you beside the hollow ships, no one of the whole host of the Danaans, not even if you name Agamemnon, who now claims to be far the best of the Achaeans."
[92] Then the blameless seer took heart, and spoke: "It is not then because of a vow that he finds fault, nor because of a hecatomb, but because of the priest whom Agamemnon dishonoured, and did not release his daughter nor accept the ransom. For this cause the god who strikes from afar has given woes and will still give them. He will not drive off from the Danaans the loathsome pestilence, until we give back to her dear father the bright-eyed maiden, unbought, unransomed, and lead a sacred hecatomb to Chryse. Then we might appease and persuade him."
[101] When he had thus spoken he sat down, and among them arose the warrior, son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon, deeply troubled. With rage his black heart was wholly filled, and his eyes were like blazing fire. To Calchas first of all he spoke, and his look threatened evil: "Prophet of evil, never yet have you spoken to me a pleasant thing; ever is evil dear to your heart to prophesy, but a word of good you have never yet spoken, nor brought to pass. And now among the Danaans you claim in prophecy that for this reason the god who strikes from afar brings woes upon them, that I would not accept the glorious ransom for the girl, the daughter of Chryses, since I much prefer to keep her in my home. For certainly I prefer her to Clytemnestra, my wedded wife, since she is not inferior to her, either in form or in stature, or in mind, or in any handiwork. Yet even so will I give her back, if that is better; I would rather the people be safe than perish. But provide me with a prize of honour forthwith, lest I alone of the Argives be without one, since that would not be proper. For you all see this, that my prize goes elsewhere."
[121] In answer to him spoke swift-footed brilliant Achilles: "Most glorious son of Atreus, most covetous of all, how shall the great-hearted Achaeans give you a prize? We know nothing of a hoard of wealth in common store, but whatever we took by pillage from the cities has been apportioned, and it is not seemly to gather these things back from the army. But give back the girl to the god, and we Achaeans will recompense you three and fourfold, if ever Zeus grants us to sack the well-walled city of Troy."
[130] In answer to him spoke lord Agamemnon: "Do not thus, mighty though you are, godlike Achilles, seek to deceive me with your wit; for you will not get by me nor persuade me. Are you willing, so that your yourself may keep your prize, for me to sit here idly in want, while you order me to give her back? No, if the great-hearted Achaeans give me a prize, suiting it to my mind, so that it will be worth just as much—but if they do not, I myself will come and take your prize, or that of Aias, or that of Odysseus I will seize and bear away. Angry will he be, to whomever I come. But these things we will consider hereafter. Let us now drag a black ship to the shining sea, and quickly gather suitable rowers into it, and place on board a hecatomb, and embark on it the fair-cheeked daughter of Chryses herself. Let one prudent man be its commander, either Aias, or Idomeneus, or brilliant Odysseus, or you, son of Peleus, of all men most extreme, so that on our behalf you may propitiate the god who strikes from afar by offering sacrifice."
[147] Glaring from beneath his brows spoke to him swift-footed Achilles: "Ah me, clothed in shamelessness, thinking of profit, how shall any man of the Achaeans obey your words with a ready heart either to go on a journey or to fight against men with force? It was not on account of the Trojan spearmen that I came here to fight, since they have done no wrong to me. Never have they driven off my cattle or my horses, nor ever in deep-soiled Phthia, nurse of men, did they lay waste the harvest, for many things lie between us—shadowy mountains and sounding sea. But you, shameless one, we followed, so that you might rejoice, seeking to win recompense for Menelaus and for yourself, dog-face, from the Trojans. This you disregard, and take no heed of. And now you threaten that you will yourself take my prize away from me, for which I toiled so much, which the sons of the Achaeans gave to me. Never have I prize like yours, whenever the Achaeans sack a well-inhabited citadel of the Trojans. The brunt of furious battle do my hands undertake, but if ever an apportionment comes, your prize is far greater, while small but dear is the reward I take to my ships, when I have worn myself out in the fighting. Now I will go back to Phthia, since it is far better to return home with my beaked ships, nor do I intend while I am here dishonoured to pile up riches and wealth for you."
[172] Then the king of men, Agamemnon, answered him: "Flee then, if your heart urges you; I do not beg you to remain for my sake. With me are others who will honour me, and above all Zeus, the lord of counsel.  Most hateful to me are you of all the kings that Zeus nurtures, for always strife is dear to you, and wars and battles. If you are very strong, it was a god, I think, who gave you this gift. Go home with your ships and your companions and lord it over the Myrmidons; for you I care not, nor take heed of your wrath. But I will threaten you thus: as Phoebus Apollo takes from me the daughter of Chryses, her with my ship and my companions I will send back, but I will myself come to your tent and take the fair-cheeked Briseis, your prize, so that you will understand how much mightier I am than you, and another may shrink from declaring himself my equal and likening himself to me to my face."
[187] So he spoke. Grief came upon the son of Peleus, and within his shaggy breast his heart was divided, whether he should draw his sharp sword from beside his thigh, and break up the assembly, and slay the son of Atreus, or stay his anger and curb his spirit. While he pondered this in mind and heart, and was drawing from its sheath his great sword, Athene came from heaven. The white-armed goddess Hera had sent her forth,  for in her heart she loved and cared for both men alike. She stood behind him, and seized the son of Peleus by his fair hair, appearing to him alone. No one of the others saw her. Achilles was seized with wonder, and turned around, and immediately recognized Pallas Athene. Terribly her eyes shone.Then he addressed her with winged words, and said: "Why now, daughter of aegis-bearing Zeus, have you come? Is it so that you might see the arrogance of Agamemnon, son of Atreus? One thing I will tell you, and I think this will be brought to pass: through his own excessive pride shall he presently lose his life."
[206] Him then the goddess, bright-eyed Athene, answered: "I have come from heaven to stay your anger, if you will obey, The goddess white-armed Hera sent me forth, for in her heart she loves and cares for both of you. But come, cease from strife, and do not grasp the sword with your hand. With words indeed taunt him, telling him how it shall be. For thus will I speak, and this thing shall truly be brought to pass. Hereafter three times as many glorious gifts shall be yours on account of this arrogance. But refrain, and obey us."
[215] In answer to her spoke swift-footed Achilles: "It is necessary, goddess, to observe the words of you two, however angered a man be in his heart, for is it better so. Whoever obeys the gods, to him do they gladly give ear."
[219] He spoke, and stayed his heavy hand on the silver hilt, and back into its sheath thrust the great sword, and did not disobey the word of Athene. She returned to Olympus to the palace of aegis-bearing Zeus, to join the company of the other gods. 
[222] But the son of Peleus again addressed with violent words the son of Atreus, and in no way ceased from his wrath: "Heavy with wine, with the face of a dog but the heart of a deer, never have you had courage to arm for battle along with your people, or go forth to an ambush with the chiefs of the Achaeans. That seems to you even as death. Indeed it is far better throughout the wide camp of the Achaeans to deprive of his prize whoever speaks contrary to you. People-devouring king, since you rule over nobodies; else, son of Atreus, this would be your last piece of insolence. But I will speak out to you, and will swear thereto a mighty oath: by this staff, that shall never more put forth leaves or shoots since first it left its stump among the mountains, nor shall it again grow green, for the bronze has stripped it on all sides of leaves and bark, and now the sons of the Achaeans carry it in their hands when they act as judges, those who guard the ordinances that come from Zeus; and this shall be for you a mighty oath. Surely some day a longing for Achilles will come upon the sons of the Achaeans one and all, and on that day you will not be able to help them at all, for all your grief, when many shall fall dying before man-slaying Hector. But you will gnaw the heart within you, in anger that you did no honour to the best of the Achaeans."
[245] So spoke the son of Peleus, and down to the earth he dashed the staff studded with golden nails, and himself sat down, while over against him the son of Atreus continued to vent his wrath. Then among them arose Nestor, sweet of speech, the clear-voiced orator of the Pylians, from whose tongue flowed speech sweeter than honey. Two generations of mortal men had passed away in his lifetime, who had been born and reared with him before in sacred Pylos, and he was king among the third. He with good intent addressed the gathering and spoke among them: "Comrades, great grief has come upon the land of Achaea. Truly would Priam and the sons of Priam rejoice, and the rest of the Trojans would be most glad at heart, were they to hear all this of you two quarrelling, you who are chief among the Danaans in counsel and chief in war. Listen to me, for you are both younger than I. In earlier times I moved among men more warlike than you, and never did they despise me. Such warriors have I never since seen, nor shall I see, as Peirithous was and Dryas, shepherd of the people, and Caeneus and Exadius and godlike Polyphemus, and Theseus, son of Aegeus, a man like the immortals. Mightiest were these of men reared upon the earth; mightiest were they, and with the mightiest they fought, the mountain-dwelling centaurs, and they destroyed them terribly. With these men I had fellowship, when I came from Pylos, from a distant land far away; for they themselves called me. And I fought on my own; with those men could no one fight of the mortals now upon the earth. Yes, and they listened to my counsel, and obeyed my words. So also should you obey, since to obey is better. Neither do you, mighty though you are, take away the girl, but let her be, as the sons of the Achaeans first gave her to him as a prize; nor do you, son of Peleus, be minded to strive with a king, might against might, for it is no common honour that is the portion of a sceptre-holding king, to whom Zeus gives glory. If you are a stronger fighter, and a goddess mother bore you, yet he is the mightier, since he is king over more. Son of Atreus, check your rage. Indeed, I beg you to let go your anger against Achilles, who is for all the Achaeans a mighty bulwark in evil war."
[285] In answer to him spoke lord Agamemnon: "All these things, old man, to be sure, you have spoken as is right. But this man wishes to be above all others; over all he wishes to rule and over all to be king, and to all to give orders; in this, I think, there is someone who will not obey. If the gods who exist for ever made him a spearman, do they therefore license him to keep uttering insults?"
[292] Brilliant Achilles broke in upon him and replied: Surely I would be called cowardly and of no account, if I am to yield to you in every matter that you say. On others lay these commands, but do not give orders to me, for I do not think I shall obey you any longer. And another thing I will tell you, and take it to heart: with my hands I will not fight for the girl's sake either with you nor with any other, since you are taking away what you have given. But of all else that is mine by my swift black ship, nothing will you take or carry away against my will. Come, just try, so that these too may know: forthwith will your dark blood flow forth about my spear." 
[303] So when the two had made an end of contending with violent words, they rose, and broke up the gathering beside the ships of the Achaeans. The son of Peleus went his way to his huts and his balanced ships together with the son of Menoetius, and with his men; but the son of Atreus launched a swift ship on the sea, and chose for it twenty rowers, and drove on board a hecatomb for the god, and brought the fair-cheeked daughter of Chryses and set her in the ship; and Odysseus of many wiles went on board to take command.
[312] So these embarked and sailed over the watery ways; but the son of Atreus bade the people purify themselves. And they purified themselves, and cast the defilement into the sea, and offered to Apollo perfect hecatombs of bulls and goats by the shore of the barren sea; and the savour thereof went up to heaven, eddying amid the smoke. Thus were they busied throughout the camp; but Agamemnon did not cease from the strife with which he had first threatened Achilles, but called to Talthybius and Eurybates, who were his heralds and ready squires: "Go to the hut of Achilles, Peleus' son, and take by the hand the fair-cheeked Briseis, and lead her hither; and if he give her not, I will myself go with a larger company and take her; that will be even the worse for him."
[325] So saying he sent them forth, and laid upon them a stern command. Unwilling went the two along the shore of the barren sea, and came to the tents and the ships of the Myrmidons. Him they found sitting beside his tent and his black ship; and Achilles was not glad at sight of them. The two, seized with dread and in awe of the king, stood, and spoke no word to him, nor made question; but he knew in his heart, and spoke: "Hail, heralds, messengers of Zeus and men, draw near. It is not you who are guilty in my sight, but Agamemnon,  who sent you forth for the sake of the girl, Briseis. But come, Patroclus, sprung from Zeus, bring forth the girl, and give her to them to lead away. However, let these two themselves be witnesses before the blessed gods and mortal men, and before him, that ruthless king, if hereafter there shall be need of me to ward off shameful ruin from the host. Truly he rages with baneful mind, and knows not at all to look both before and after, that his Achaeans might wage war in safety beside their ships."
[345] So he spoke, and Patroclus obeyed his dear comrade, and led forth from the hut the fair-cheeked Briseis, and gave her to them to lead away. So the two went back beside the ships of the Achaeans, and with them, all unwilling, went the woman. But Achilles burst into tears, and withdrew apart from his comrades, and sat down on the shore of the grey sea, looking forth over the wine-dark deep. Earnestly he prayed to his dear mother with hands outstretched: "Mother, since you bore me, though to so brief a span of life, honour surely ought the Olympian to have given into my hands, Zeus who thunders on high; but now he has honoured me not a bit. Truly the son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon has dishonoured me: for he has taken and keeps my prize through his own arrogant act. So he spoke, weeping, and his lady mother heard him, as she sat in the depths of the sea beside the old man, her father.
[357] And speedily she came forth from the grey sea like a mist, and sat down before him, as he wept, and she stroked him with her hand, and spoke to him, and called him by name: "My child, why do you weep? What sorrow has come upon your heart? Speak out; hide it not in your mind, that we both may know."
[364]  Then with heavy moaning spoke swift-footed Achilles to her: "You know. Why then should I tell the tale to you who knows all? We went forth to Thebe, the sacred city of Eetion, and laid it waste, and brought here all the spoil. This the sons of the Achaeans divided properly among themselves, but for the son of Atreus they chose out the fair-cheeked daughter of Chryses. However, Chryses, priest of Apollo, who strikes from afar, came to the swift ships of the bronze-clad Achaeans, to free his daughter, bearing ransom past counting, and in his hands he held the wreaths of Apollo who strikes from afar, on a staff of gold, and he implored all the Achaeans, but most of all the two sons of Atreus, marshallers of the people. Then all the rest of the Achaeans shouted assent, to reverence the priest and accept the glorious ransom; yet the thing did not please the heart of Agamemnon, son of Atreus, but he sent him away harshly, and laid upon him a stern command. So the old man went back again in anger; and Apollo heard his prayer, for he was very dear to him, and sent against the Argives an evil shaft. Then the people began to die thick and fast, and the shafts of the god ranged everywhere throughout the wide camp of the Achaeans. But to us the prophet with sure knowledge declared the oracles of the god who strikes from afar."
[386] "Forthwith, then, I first bade propitiate the god, but thereafter anger seized the son of Atreus, and straightway he arose and spoke a threatening word, which now has come to pass. For the quick-glancing Achaeans are taking the maiden in a swift ship to Chryse, and are bearing gifts to the god; while the other woman the heralds have just now taken from my tent and led away, the daughter of Briseus, whom the sons of the Achaeans gave me. But, you, if you are able, guard your own son; go to Olympus and make prayer to Zeus, if ever you have gladdened his heart by word or deed. For often I have heard you glorying in the halls of my father, and declaring that you alone among the immortals warded off shameful ruin from the son of Cronos, lord of the dark clouds, on the day when the other Olympians wished to put him in bonds, even Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene. But you came, goddess, and freed him from his bonds, when you had quickly called to high Olympus him of the hundred hands, whom the gods call Briareus, but all men Aegaeon; for he is mightier than his father. He sat down by the side of the son of Cronos, exulting in his glory, and the blessed gods were seized with fear of him, and did not bind Zeus. Bring this now to his remembrance, and sit by his side, and clasp his knees, in hope that he might perhaps wish to succour the Trojans, and for those others, the Achaeans, to pen them in among the sterns of their ships and around the sea as they are slain, so that they may all have profit of their king, and that the son of Atreus, wide-ruling Agamemnon may know his blindness in that he did no honour to the best of the Achaeans."
[413] Then Thetis answered him as she wept: "Ah me, my child, why did I rear you, cursed in my child-bearing? Would that it had been your lot to remain by your ships without tears and without grief, since your span of life is brief and endures no long time; but now you are doomed to a speedy death and are laden with sorrow above all men; therefore to an evil fate I bore you in our halls. Yet in order to tell this your word to Zeus who delights in the thunderbolt I will myself go to snowy Olympus, in hope that he may be persuaded. But remain by your swift, sea-faring ships, and continue your wrath against the Achaeans, and refrain utterly from battle; for Zeus went yesterday to Oceanus, to the blameless Ethiopians for a feast, and all the gods followed with him; but on the twelfth day he will come back again to Olympus, and then will I go to the house of Zeus with threshold of bronze, and will clasp his knees in prayer, and I think I shall win him."
[428] So saying, she went her way and left him where he was, angry at heart for the fair-girdled woman's sake, whom they had taken from him by force though he was unwilling; and meanwhile Odysseus came to Chryse bringing the holy hecatomb. When they had arrived within the deep harbour, they furled the sail, and stowed it in the black ship, and the mast they lowered by the forestays and brought it to the crutch with speed, and rowed her with oars to the place of anchorage. Then they cast out the mooring-stones and made fast the stern cables, and themselves went forth upon the shore of the sea. They brought forth the hecatomb for Apollo, who strikes from afar, and forth stepped also the daughter of Chryses from the sea-faring ship. Her then did Odysseus of many wiles lead to the altar, and place in the arms of her dear father, saying to him: "Chryses, Agamemnon, king of men, sent me forth to bring to you your daughter, and to offer to Phoebus a holy hecatomb on the Danaans' behalf, that therewith we may propitiate the lord, who has now brought upon the Argives woeful lamentation."
 [446] So saying he placed her in his arms, and he joyfully took his dear child; but they made haste to set in array for the god the holy hecatomb around the well-built altar, and then they washed their hands and took up the barley grains. Then Chryses lifted up his hands, and prayed aloud for them: "Hear me, god of the silver bow, who stands over Chryse and holy Cilla, and rules mightily over Tenedos. As before you heard me when I prayed—to me you did honour, and mightily smote the host of the Achaeans—even so now fulfill me this my desire: ward off now from the Danaans the loathly pestilence."
[457] So he spoke in prayer, and Phoebus Apollo heard him. Then, when they had prayed, and had sprinkled the barley grains, they first drew back the victims' heads, and cut their throats, and flayed them, and cut out the thighs and covered them with a double layer of fat, and laid raw flesh thereon. And the old man burned them on stakes of wood, and made libation over them of gleaming wine; and beside him the young men held in their hands the five-pronged forks. But when the thigh-pieces were wholly burned, and they had tasted the entrails, they cut up the rest and spitted it, and roasted it carefully, and drew all off the spits. Then, when they had ceased from their labour and had made ready the meal, they feasted, nor did their hearts lack anything of the equal feast. But when they had put from them the desire for food and drink, the youths filled the bowls brim full of drink and served out to all, first pouring drops for libation into the cups. So the whole day long they sought to appease the god with song, singing the beautiful paean, the sons of the Achaeans, hymning the god who works from afar; and his heart was glad, as he heard. 
[475] But when the sun set and darkness came on, they lay down to rest by the stern cables of the ship, and as soon as early rosy-fingered Dawn appeared, then they set sail for the wide camp of the Achaeans. And Apollo, who works from afar, sent them a favouring wind, and they set up the mast and spread the white sail. So the wind filled the belly of the sail, and the dark wave sang loudly about the stem of the ship, as she went, and she sped over the wave, accomplishing her way. But when they came to the wide camp of the Achaeans, they drew the black ship up on the shore, high upon the sands, and set in line the long props beneath, and themselves scattered among the tents and ships. But he in his wrath sat beside his swift-faring ships, the Zeus-sprung son of Peleus, swift-footed Achilles. Never did he go forth to the place of gathering, where men win glory, nor ever to war, but wasted away his own heart, as he tarried where he was; and he longed for the war-cry and the battle.
[493] Now when the twelfth morning thereafter had come, then into Olympus came the gods who are for ever, all in one company, and Zeus led the way. And Thetis did not forget the behest of her son, but rose up from the wave of the sea, and at early morning went up to great heaven and Olympus. There she found the far-seeing son of Cronos sitting apart from the rest upon the topmost peak of many-ridged Olympus. So she sat down before him, and clasped his knees with her left hand, while with her right she touched him beneath the chin, and she spoke in prayer to king Zeus, son of Cronos: "Father Zeus, if ever amid the immortals I gave you aid by word or deed, grant me this prayer: do honour to my son, who is doomed to a speedy death beyond all other men; yet now Agamemnon, king of men, has dishonoured him, for he has taken and keeps his prize by his own arrogant act. But honour him, Olympian Zeus, lord of counsel; and give might to the Trojans, until the Achaeans do honour to my son, and magnify him with recompense."
[511] So she spoke; but Zeus, the cloud-gatherer, spoke no word to her, but sat a long time in silence. Yet Thetis, even as she had clasped his knees, so held to him, clinging close, and questioned him again a second time: "Give me your infallible promise, and bow your head to it, or else deny me, for there is nothing to make you afraid; so that I may know well  how far I among all the gods am honoured the least."
[517] Then, greatly troubled, Zeus, the cloud-gatherer spoke to her: "Surely this will be sorry work, since you will set me on to engage in strife with Hera, when she shall anger me with taunting words. Even now she always upbraids me among the immortal gods, and declares that I give aid to the Trojans in battle. But for the present, depart again, lest Hera note something; and I will take thought for these things to bring all to pass. Come, I will bow my head to you, that thou may be certain, for this from me is the surest token among the immortals; no word of mine may be recalled, nor is false, nor unfulfilled, to which I bow my head."
[528] The son of Cronos spoke, and bowed his dark brow in assent, and the ambrosial locks waved from the king's immortal head; and he made great Olympus quake.
[531] When the two had taken counsel together in this way, they parted; she leapt straightway into the deep sea from gleaming Olympus, and Zeus went to his own palace. All the gods together rose from their seats before the face of their father; no one dared to await his coming, but they all rose up before him. So he sat down there upon his throne; but Hera saw, and failed not to note how silver-footed Thetis, daughter of the old man of the sea, had taken counsel with him. Forthwith then she spoke to Zeus, son of Cronos, with mocking words: "Who of the gods, crafty one, has now again taken counsel with you? Always is it your pleasure to hold aloof from me, and to give judgments which you have pondered in secret, nor have you ever brought yourself with a ready heart to declare to me the matter which you devise."
[544]  In answer to her spoke the father of men and gods: "Hera, do not hope to know all my words: ard will they prove for you, though you are my wife. Whatever it is fitting for you to hear, this none other shall know before you, whether of gods or men; but what I wish to devise apart from the gods, of all this do not in any way inquire nor ask."
[551] In answer to him spoke the ox-eyed lady Hera: "Most dread son of Cronos, what a word you have said! Truly, in the past I have not been accustomed to inquire nor ask you, but at your ease you devise all things whatever you wish. But now I have wondrous dread at heart, lest silver-footed Thetis, daughter of the old man of the sea, have beguiled you; for at early dawn she sat by you and clasped your knees. To her, I think, you bowed your head in sure token that you will honour Achilles, and bring many to death beside the ships of the Achaeans."
[560] Then in answer to her spoke Zeus, the cloud-gatherer: "Strange one, you are always suspecting, and I do not escape you; yet you shall be able to accomplish nothing, but shall be even further from my heart; and that shall be the worse for you. If this thing is as you say, then it must be pleasing to me. Sit down in silence, and obey my word, lest all the gods that are in Olympus avail you not against my drawing near, when I put forth upon you my irresistible hands."
[568] He spoke, and ox-eyed lady Hera was seized with fear, and sat down in silence, curbing her heart. Then troubled were the gods of heaven throughout the palace of Zeus, and among them Hephaestus, the famed craftsman, was first to speak, doing pleasure to his dear mother, white-armed Hera: "Surely this will be sorry work, that is no longer bearable, if you two are to wrangle thus for mortals' sakes, and set the gods in tumult; neither will there be any joy in the excellent feast, since worse things prevail. And I give counsel to my mother, wise though she be herself, to do pleasure to our dear father Zeus, that the father upbraid her not again, and bring confusion upon our feast. What if the Olympian, the lord of the lightning, were minded to dash us from our seats! for he is mightiest far. But address him with gentle words; so shall the Olympian forthwith be gracious to us."
[584] So saying, he sprang up and placed in his dear mother's hand the double cup, and spoke to her: "Be patient, my mother, and endure for all your grief, lest, dear as you are to me, my eyes see you stricken, and then I shall in no way be able to succour you for all my sorrow; for a hard foe is the Olympian to meet in strife. On a time before this, when I was striving to save you, he caught me by the foot and hurled me from the heavenly threshold; the whole day long I was carried headlong, and at sunset I fell in Lemnos, and but little life was in me. There the Sintian folk quickly tended me for my fall."
[595] So he spoke, and the goddess, white-armed Hera, smiled, and smiling took in her hand the cup from her son. Then he poured wine for all the other gods from left to right, drawing forth sweet nectar from the bowl. And unquenchable laughter arose among the blessed gods, as they saw Hephaestus puffing through the palace. 
[601] Thus the whole day long till the setting of the sun they feasted, nor did their heart lack anything of the equal feast, nor of the beauteous lyre, that Apollo held, nor yet of the Muses, who sang, replying one to the other with sweet voices.
[605] But when the bright light of the sun was set, they went each to his own house to take their rest, where for each one a palace had been built with cunning skill by the famed Hephaestus, the limping god; and Zeus, the Olympian, lord of the lightning, went to his couch, where of old he took his rest, whenever sweet sleep came upon him. There went he up and slept, and beside him lay Hera of the golden throne.

-=-=-TITLE:  84.02.09: The <b>Iliad</b>u2014A Practical Approach
-=-=-SNIPPET:  s students are not receptive to nancient literature, and since there are more immediately appealing, modern,xa0..., u
-=-=-TEXT:   Three important, practical reasons, I believe, for students to study this long, complex poem are: students will learn a little about an ancient world whose ideas have greatly influenced our own world; students will become familiar with the first piece of literature the western world has to offer, and students will discover an eventful, exciting war story. Additionally, with a little luck, some students will gain insight into the minds of men in the desperate circumstances of war.
  The objectives of this unit are to help students:
(2) Become familiar with the events and characters of the Iliad, a foundation block of western literature, and explore the idea of the hero.  
(3) Examine the effects of war on individuals and gain insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the human heart.  
  The poem begins with a dispute between the Greek king, Agamemnon, and the great soldier and Greek prince, Achilles. After a recent battle, each Greek hero has received spoils as his reward for victory. The king has received the most wealth and a beautiful woman, Chryseis, and each warrior has received his share of the spoils according to his rank and heroism.
  Achilles realizes that this scourge may be divine retribution and asks Calchas, a prophet, why they are suffering. Chalchas, after extracting a promise of protection from Achilles, explains that Agamemnon has offended Apollo by refusing to return Chryseis.
  Thetis does as her son bids, and Zeus agrees with the result that the gods, already divided in their loyalties, enter the fray, each god fighting for or protecting his or her own: Athena and Hera supporting the Greeks while Apollo and Aphrodite support Troy. This expansion of hostilities further complicates the relationships among the Trojans, the Greeks, and their gods, and the resulting disputes form the basis of this epic poem.
  But why are the Greeks and Trojans fighting? Why are the gods displaying so much love or hatred for one or the other side?
  The answers lie in the events of Greek myths and legends which occur before this poem begins, and in the relationship the ancient Greeks had with their gods and goddesses.
  Before students begin to read the Iliad, they need to learn about the legend of Paris and Helen. This can be done by film or filmstrip, by reading the story or simply by the instructor telling students the story.
  He next examined Athena who promised to make Paris victorious in all battles. She also promised to make him the most handsome and wise man in the world. Paris also refused this offer.
  The ancient Greeks viewed the cause of the Trojan war not only as a dispute among men but also as a desire of the gods. In effect, one is led to believe upon reading the Iliad that if the gods had not involved themselves men might have settled their differences with much less bloodshed. In this story, men are in a moral sense better than gods.
  This view of the relationship between man and the divine is very different from the ordinary view of things in our present primarily Judeo-Christian society. Most of our students and ourselves think of the divinity as one being who has the ability to control everything (though he may not choose to do so) and who understands everything.
  In the Iliad there are multiple gods, each having his own specialty and all loosely controlled by a leader, Zeus, in the same way men are often governed by a king or other dictator.
  The Judeo-Christian god in addition to being all-powerful and all knowing is also thought of today as a just being who has the care and protection of mankind as goals.
In the Iliad also, horses speak, the four winds are goddesses, and fire is a god, Haephaestos, who fights at one point with the river, Xanthos. These are only a few examples of the manner in which the ancient Greeks personified objects.
  An epic is a long, complex story, often told in poetic form. The events in an epic are usually proclaimed to be true or divinely inspired, and often derive from the myths, legends, and religions of the civilization from which the epic comes.
  Although length and complexity are hallmarks of the epic poem, the most important element is the hero. The hero of an epic is a human being with characteristics a society admires and often wishes to emulate. The hero is male, attractive, and unusually strong and able. He is a trained soldier or warrior and believes in and follows a code of honor for which he is willing to sacrifice his life. He fights for the noble cause: those who cannot defend themselves, usually women and children, the preservation of a society, honor and the noble way of life. The hero is considered better in most respects than the common man.
  However, the hero is also in many ways the same as the ordinary man. He has the same longings and desires as any man might have: the desire to be beloved and respected by his own, the desire for some degree of wealth or material comfort, the desire for a family with children, especially sons like himself, the desire to stand out above his fellow human beings in some way, the desire not to bring shame to himself or his family in any way. The hero also hopes that the divine will favor him and his cause.
  The hero becomes tragic when some error or fault, often inborn, of his own making, brings about his own death and usually the destruction of others. Often the hero has insight and realizes before anyone else what his fate will be. However, for reasons of his own, he forges ahead. The hero is mortal and vulnerable.
  Hector remains intimately bound to his family and society and must at all costs defend them. He does not want to fight a war which his brother has provoked. Hector clearly sees his ultimate defeat and the destruction of his city. However, he cannot do anything that will bring disgrace to himself and his family.
  There are many articles and books which analyze in great depth Achilles and Hector as hero. The instructor will find a few of these texts in the bibliography of this paper. An important aspect of this section is that students should learn something about the nature of a hero in epic literature. Having students describe what they think is heroic and comparing contrasting their ideas with those of the poet is an effective way to help them understand why Achilles and Hector, as the heroes, behave as they do.
  Most high school texts containing the lliad describe Homer as a specific individual who authored the Iliad. The fact is that no one really knows for certain who wrote the poem. The lliad was probably written in the eighth century B.C. when alphabetic writing was introduced to Greece, but the events described in the story took place in the 13th century B.C. or approximately 500 years before the story was written down.
  Most Hellenists, at least in America, believe that the story was passed along in the oral tradition by story-tellers who received food and shelter, and later money, for their talents. Before the written word the stories were not memorized per se. The poet knew the folk legends and myths of his people. He also knew the meter in which his poem was to be spoken, and he had a ready supply of stock phrases tailored to specific characters and events. With this knowledge the poet was able to convey thousands of stories to his audience. Each story was a little different each time the poet told it because he wove a little bit of his own invention into the telling of the story. There were many papyrus versions of the Iliad, each a little different from the other. Imagine the great variety of oral renditions of this story there must have been!
  It is the inconsistencies in narrative of the Iliad and the Odyssey which have been and still are the cause of controversy among scholars concerning the authorship of these two epics. An example of one kind of inconsistency which puzzles scholars is the following. In book five of the lliad Pylaimenes, king of the Paphlagonians, is slain. However, in book thirteen, Pylaimenes reappears mourning the death of his son Harpalion.
  Another kind of difficulty which fans the controversy are the varying interpretations given to particular passages of the Iliad. Albin Lesky in History of Greek Literature uses as an example of this the wall that the Greeks built to protect their ships. Some theorists claim that there is no plausible reason for the wall building, others say it is an integral part of the plot, and still others feel that the wall is symbolic or that it was an invention of the poet.
  The results of these inconsistencies are several theories about how the poem was written. The Iliad and the Odyssey were first analyzed by the Alexandrians, some of whom theorized that the two epics were written by different poets but who did not pull apart the individual epics. Starting in the eighteenth century there came analytic theorists who thought there were many poems which had been combined into one. The unitarian theory states that one poet created entirely both the Iliad and the Odyssey, or at least each epic was written by one individual. The expansion theory maintains there was an original core to which other episodes are attached. Though there is little objective data to decisively favor one theory over another, modern theorists tend to support the idea that the Iliad and Odyssey developed from the oral tradition and that the poet who wrote them down was probably one man who gathered material from many sources and in addition added new material of his own. Some scholars propose that the composer was illiterate and dictated the work to a scribe; others contend that he wrote his own manuscript.
  Some students may be interested enough in this question to do some research themselves. The bibliography at the end of this paper, while intended primarily for teachers, is a good starting point.
  The intent of this unit is to make the Iliad accessible to most students. The goal of this section is to provide suggestions to make study of the Iliad more enjoyable. The instructor should choose those ideas most adaptable to his or her way of teaching.
  I have whittled the 24 books to ten, but if more time is needed I think books 6, 11, and 18 can be summarized with little loss of understanding.
(3) Introduce the story of Paris and Helen before the lliad is begun. It can be read or viewed as a motion picture or given to students to present to the class or simply told by the instructor.

-=-=-TITLE:  An <b>Iliad</b> | Guthrie Theater
-=-=-SNIPPET:  An Iliad. October 01 - October 20, 2013 in the Dowling Studio. thumbnail_AnIliad.njpg. About the Show; Multimedia; Cast and Staff; Resources. adapted fromxa0...
-=-=-TEXT: Just 20 chances to see one of the best performances of 2013! An Iliad  features Guthrie regular Stephen Yoakam in a solo performance the Star  Tribune hailed a “tour de force” and City Pages called “riveting!”    
 "Every time I sing this song, I hope it's the last  time." So says The Poet as he digs deep to sing Homer's epic story of war,  honor, violence and the Greek siege of the city of Troy. He's told this story  for centuries, conjuring the heroes and battles for different cultures and eras.  Now in the shadow of war in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria, he unleashes the  story's power for a modern audience. As The Poet recites, comments and chats, he  compels his audience to connect with his story, to feel what he feels, to  believe in the importance of this story. Maybe if he tells the story one more  time, the violence will end. 
An Iliad premiered in 2010 and has been lauded by  critics across the country, including The New York Times this spring: "Mr. O'Hare and Ms. Peterson have telescoped the mighty expanses of  Homer's great poem into an evening that scales the conflict of the Trojan War  down to an intimate solo show illuminating both the heroism and the horror of  warfare." 
 "Actor Stephen Yoakam portrays this poet -- a prophet really -- who scalds our conscience with a celebration of war far more powerful than any condemnation." ~Star Tribune
 "But it's also a visually arresting, sumptuously performed piece of theater that is intellectually and emotionally engaging. ... It's a rangy, eclectic and sometimes electric performance, filled with bravura moments." ~Pioneer Press  
 The production contains strong language.
 Seating in the Dowling Studio is general admission and begins 30 minutes before curtain. After the show begins, patrons who leave the theater will not be readmitted.

-=-=-TITLE: Bouygues Telecom toujours dans le rouge
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: Bouygues Telecom toujours dans le rouge Les Echos | Le 13/05 à 12:54 Suivant L’opérateur a accusé une perte nette de 49 millions d’euros au premier trimestre 2015, après une perte de 41 millions d’euros en 2014. 
Bouygues Telecom, qui a connu une année 2014 difficile, est resté dans le rouge au premier trimestre, avec une perte nette de 49 millions d’euros au premier trimestre, après une perte nette de 41 millions d’euros sur l’année 2014. 
Il maintient cependant ses objectifs annuels inchangés, tablant sur un retour de la croissance en 2016. Si son chiffre d’affaires global a reculé de 2% à 1,063 milliard d’euros, il est légèrement supérieur aux attentes des analystes. Le résultat brut d’exploitation ( Ebitda ) est resté quant à lui stable à 118 millions d’euros. Selon l’opérateur, cette stabilité s’explique par le fait que le «?repricing du parc client?» (mouvement de baisse généralisée des prix de l’activité mobile consécutif à l’arrivée de Free sur le marché début 2012, Ndlr) a été compensé «?par les économies de coûts?». 
Bouygues Telecom se félicite de «?bonnes performances?» à la fois dans le mobile et dans le fixe, y voyant une confirmation de la «?pertinence de sa stratégie?», axée notamment sur l’offre 4G, dont il a fait son fer de lance. Il indique ainsi avoir gagné 197.000 clients forfait sur le premier trimestre 2015 dont 146.000 sans compter les forfaits MtoM (machine to machine). L’opérateur note que 31% de ses clients mobile sont utilisateurs de ce réseau (contre 13% à fin mars 2014) «?et consomment en moyenne 2,2 Giga octets d’internet mobile par mois?». 
Sur le marché du haut débit fixe, Bouygues Telecom se targue d’être le « ?leader en termes de croissance nette pour le sixième trimestre consécutif ?», avec 96.000 nouveaux clients au premier trimestre 2015. Plan de transformation 
L’opérateur annonce par ailleurs poursuivre le déploiement de son plan de transformation, estimant que près de 90% de ses clients étaient, à fin mars 2015, positionnés sur la nouvelle gamme simplifiée d’offres, basée sur sept plans tarifaires, qu’il a lancée en novembre.«? Nous avons commencé dès le mois de novembre 2014 à migrer l’intégralité de nos clients sur ces nouveaux plans tarifaires? », a précisé lors d’une conférence téléphonique Eric Haentjens, directeur général adjoint fonctions supports de l’opérateur. 
A la fin du mois de mai, l’intégralité de la base de clients mobile de l’opérateur sera positionnée sur les offres de ce catalogue simplifié, a ajouté M. Haentjens, ce qui signera la fin du «?repricing?». Nouvelle stratégie 
A la suite à son échec l’an passé face à Numericable pour le rachat de SFR, l’opérateur avait en effet été contraint de revoir sa stratégie. Dans ce cadre, un plan de départs volontaires de 1.400 salariés a été réalisé à fin janvier 2015. 
Après avoir fusionné ses offres mobile avec celles de sa marque low-cost B& You , l’opérateur a notamment sorti en janvier 2015 sa nouvelle box Miami qui doit lui permettre de regagner des parts de marché sur le triple-play (internet, téléphonie fixe et télévision). 
Au titre des perspectives pour 2015, Bouygues Telecom maintient les objectifs déjà annoncés, à savoir « ?une stabilité de son Ebitda ?» et « ?une légère hausse de ses investissements en lien avec la mise en oeuvre de la mutualisation d’une partie du réseau mobile avec le groupe Numericable-SFR ainsi que le développement du réseau fixe ?». 
Pour le premier trimestre 2015, ces charges non courantes liées à la mise en oeuvre du partage de réseau avec Numericable-SFR pèsent pour 22 millions sur le résultat opérationnel de Bouygues Telecom. 
Alors que des rumeurs récurrentes font état d’un possible rachat de Bouygues Telecom par Iliad-Free ou Numericable-SFR (Altice), Martin Bouygues, patron du groupe, a de nouveau écarté tout rapprochement de sa filiale télécom avec un autre opérateur, affirmant que «? la question de (sa) vente ne se pose pas? », lors de l’assemblée générale des actionnaires le 23 avril.

-=-=-TITLE:  Tired of Being Rebuffed, France&#39;s <b>Iliad</b> Ends Bid for T-Mobile US <b>...</b>
-=-=-SNIPPET:  Oct 13, 2014 ... By making an offer worth nearly as much as its own market value, the French ncompany, Iliad, appeared to be a minnow trying to swallow axa0...
-=-=-TEXT: Updated, 7:16 p.m. | From the start, it was one of the most audacious takeover attempts in recent memory. An upstart French telecommunications company was trying this year to buy control of T-Mobile US, the big American wireless provider, for $15 billion.
By making an offer worth nearly as much as its own market value, the French company, Iliad, appeared to be a minnow trying to swallow a whale.
As if that weren’t ambitious enough, Iliad was doing so while T-Mobile US was in talks about a merger with Sprint, hoping to create a true third rival to Verizon Wireless and AT&T, the two largest American cellphone carriers.
But on Monday, Iliad’s odyssey came to an end. In a statement, the French company said was ending its efforts to take over T-Mobile US, despite having increased the size of the stake it was willing to acquire and the price it was willing to pay.
T-Mobile and its largest shareholder, the German telecommunications group Deutsche Telekom, were uninterested in the first offer, or a sweetened bid that was recently presented. As a result, Iliad ended its efforts “following exchanges with Deutsche Telekom and selected board members of T-Mobile US who have refused to entertain its new offer.”
In July, Iliad offered $15 billion for 56.6 percent of T-Mobile US, a surprising move that announced the global ambitions of Iliad, which has disrupted the market for cellphone plans in France.
Founded by Xavier Niel, a billionaire entrepreneur who is also an owner of the newspaper Le Monde, Iliad has taken share from established players by offering cheap cellular phone plans. That is similar to the strategy followed by T-Mobile’s chief executive, John Legere, suggesting the two companies might be a good cultural fit.
Iliad claimed it could create $10 billion in cost savings, an enormous number under any circumstances, and one that left many analysts puzzled, considering that the French company had no presence in the United States market.
T-Mobile US rejected the bid from Iliad, dismissing the French company as lacking credibility. Financing such a deal would have been difficult, saddling Iliad with billions of dollars in debt. And since Iliad made its original offer for T-Mobile, its market value has fallen steeply, complicating any potential offer.
Meanwhile, T-Mobile’s prospects of being acquired by Sprint fell apart later in the summer, after Sprint and its parent company, SoftBank of Japan, decided a combination was unlikely to win approval from antitrust regulators.
That left T-Mobile US pursing a stand-alone strategy, competing with Sprint for the spot of a distant third player behind Verizon Wireless and AT&T. Yet the prospect of a credible bid from Iliad lingered, at least until Monday.
Shares of T-Mobile US fell 2.5 percent on Monday, and were down a further 2 percent in after-hours trading.
On Monday, Iliad said it had increased its offer and was willing to acquire 67 percent of T-Mobile US, up from the original 56.6 percent, and that it was prepared to pay $36 a share, up from its original offer of $33 a share. But it said T-Mobile and Deutsche Telekom were uninterested in these terms, too.
“Iliad had the ambition to accelerate T-Mobile US’ transformation, notably by saving more than $2 billion of cost annually,” Iliad said in a statement. “This transaction would have created significant value for both Iliad’s and T-Mobile US’ shareholders. The Iliad Group will continue its profitable growth policy as it has been conducted over the last 15 years in the interest of its subscribers, employees and shareholders.”
T-Mobile US declined to comment, and Mr. Legere, a prolific user of Twitter, did not mention Iliad’s withdrawal in any of his tweets on Monday.

-=-=-TITLE: Let's Guess What J. Lo's Las Vegas Residency Will Be Like
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: Eric Thurm Follow Eric Thurm During the season finale of the not long for this world American Idol, Jennifer Lopez announced a Las Vegas residency that, if there is justice in the world, will extend past its original January-June dates and eventually rival Celine Dion's show as a permanent, glorious fixture of the city. In a statement, J-Lo says that the show will be a "multifacted high energy Jenny from the block party," suggesting it will be similar to other Vegas revues. But wouldn't it be more fun if the show were entirely based on one of Jenny's past movie roles? Here are a few possibilities: The Cell Everyone always forgets about The Cell, the Tarsem Singh movie in which J. Lo plays a child psychologist who has to literally venture into the twisted mind of a serial killer (Vincent D'Onofrio, naturally) in order to save a kidnapped woman. In this version of the show, the entire audience takes hallucinogens and tries to agree on the weirdest form of torture. Occasionally Vince Vaughn (who plays the FBI agent teamed with Lopez) shows up. Gigli Each night, as penance for creating Gigli, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck must enact a Greek tragedy anew, in which thousands of people come to see them be ritually punished, going through the motions of their relationship and breakup, but never quite making it to the point where one of them is stable and successful and the other is Batman. It is very similar to that one episode of Black Mirror . Monster-in-Law Jennifer Lopez has a staged supernatural fight with Jane Fonda. Expensive pyrotechnics, antique swords, full-sized mecha suits are involved. The Boy Next Door An extended reading of the first edition of the Iliad (but sexy).

But the Grizzlies, faced by the Splash Brothers Klay Thompson and Steph Curry in their blue uniforms, did not run in panic to their locker room nor call a timeout, but fell back steadily as they became aware of Steph’s presence on the Warriors’ side. And who were the first and last of them to fall to Klay son of Mychal and to baby-faced Steph? Hibbert-like Asik was the first; then Jrue, maker of plays; Anderson, a Sacramentan sharpshooter; Tyreke; Davis' son Anthony; and Norris with his glittering rings, who lived in New Orleans on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico where he looked after his rich estate, with other Pelicans for neighbours in the fertile countryside. 
When the power forward Randolph saw the Grizzlies being slaughtered in the heat of Game 4, he immediately spoke to Gasol with winged words: 
"Center of Memphis who does it all, Marc, this is disastrous. If we let deadly Steph run wild like this, what of the promise we made to Memphis when we told them we would sack Oracle with its fine walls before we returned with the ring? Come: time for the two of us to summon up that fighting spirit of ours!"

深淵巨蟹
原本就殘破不堪的身軀又經過了死靈法術的改造，烏爾加特因為詭異的四肢（應該說六肢才對）外型常被當做螃蟹，不過他還真的有個螃蟹造型。右肩上那個被抓走的可憐女人是誰就先別管了，「深淵巨蟹」烏爾加特的雙手是顯眼的蟹腳與蟹鉗，此外還忠實呈現螃蟹被煮熟的顏色（？），不過這個樣子還是跟美味的大閘蟹差遠了就是…（而且烏爾加特應該有毒才對）
「溫泉泡太久就變這樣。」
探戈靈魂
可能有些召喚師不知道逆命居然曾經和伊芙琳有段情，雖然已經是過去式了，不過能和伊芙琳交往肯定要有兩把刷子，畢竟她可是「黑寡婦」啊（抖抖）！「探戈靈魂」就是兩人成雙成對的造型，穿著鮮紅西裝的逆命嘴裡還銜著一朵玫瑰，與裝扮同樣鮮紅的伊芙琳跳著源自於阿根廷的雙人舞蹈，如果再次遇上了「探戈靈魂」伊芙琳，不知道她會不會願意賞臉與逆命共舞一段呢？
「伊芙琳老是搞失蹤，還好我有大絕。」
劍牙猛騎
在聯盟裡擁有內建坐騎這個禮遇的英雄少之又少，而弗雷爾卓德的好戰派、冬之爪部落的領導者史瓦妮就是其中之一。為了在森林中盡情甩尾，「劍牙猛騎」史瓦妮的坐騎也換了一隻正統山豬；大地色系的裝備與大自然的環境融為一體，手中的冰星錘雖然變成木製的，不過上頭的獸牙釘刺敲下去可不是鬧著玩的，而且大絕一樣可以冰得你動彈不得！
「閃開閃開，撞到有聲喔～～～」
斯巴達意志
造型原文邁爾彌頓人（Myrmidon）在希臘歷史中是傳奇性的戰士，古希臘詩人荷馬的敘事史詩伊利亞德（Iliad）則提到他們是由阿基里斯所領導。在聯盟中同樣也是驍勇善戰的代表人物，「斯巴達意志」潘森擁有的可是更驚人的戰鬥意志，做為拉克爾部落的楷模，潘森向來都沒丟過「戰爭之王」這個稱號的臉！
「把人踢進坑裡，就這麼簡單～」
「墮～天～一～擊～～～！」潘森暴喝一聲後便英勇地朝混亂的戰場飛去，抵達現場後發現是卡力斯和露璐在等著他！一邊是等著你落單給你一個痛快的虛空掠食者，一邊是和小妖精皮克斯嘻嘻哈哈地要把你變形的精靈魔法使，身為當中唯一的正常人，戰爭之王有辦法在【本週英雄半價優惠】中殺出一條血路嗎？

-=-=-TEXT: For nine full years             the Greeks lay siege to Troy, until finally, in the tenth year of the             war, the city was captured and destroyed. But in telling the story in             the Iliad, Homer focuses not on the famous strategem of the Wooden Horse             and the final battle but instead on the outbreak of a personal quarrel             within the Greek ranks, and discovers in this unlikely source the seed             of a tragedy which will overwhelm victors and vanquished alike. Writes             Sheila Murnaghan (in her introduction to Stanley Lombardo's translation             of the Iliad [Hackett Publishing Co., Inc, 1997], pp. xvii-xix): 
"The Iliad                 is the story of a raging anger and its human toll. The poem recounts                 'the rage of Achilles,' the greatest of the Greek heroes fighting in                 the war against Troy.... This far-reaching fury has its origins, not                 in the enmity of the Greeks and Trojans, but in the day-to-day tensions                 of the Greek camp, where a long-standing rivalry between Achilles and                 his commander Agamemnon flares up in a bitter quarrel. As it opens with                 this episode of internecine strife, the Iliad draws us into a world                 of warrior aristocrats for whom honor, gained and regained in the front                 lines of battle, is paramount. Under conditions of extreme pressure,                 their carefully cultivated distinctions of status give way to contention                 and hostility.... The rest of the Iliad works out (the) consequences,                 charting the course of Achilles' rage as it intensifies, changes directions,                 and finally subsides. Achilles' self-willed estrangement from his former                 companions places him in unexpected situations that open up new and                 often painful perspectives on his role as a supremely great warrior."
Stanley Lombardo is             Professor of Classics at the University of Kansas. A native of New Orleans,             Professor Lombardo holds his Ph.D. from the University of Texas (1976).             At the University of Kansas, he teaches Greek and Latin at all levels,             as well as general courses on Greek literature and culture. He was recently             awarded a Kemper Teaching Fellowship by the university. 
Professor Lombardo's             publications are primarily literary translations of Greek poetry, including             Homer's Iliad (Hackett, 1997; reviewed in the New York Times, 7/20/97;             recipient of the Byron Caldwell Book Award; performed by Aquila Theatre             Company at Lincoln Center, 1999); Homer's Odyssey (Hackett, 2000; reviewed             in the New York Times, 7/09/00); and translations of Plato, Hesiod, Callimachus             and others. He is currently working on a translation of Sappho. 
Professor Lombardo             has given dramatic readings of his translations on campuses throughout             the country, as well as at such venues as the Smithsonian Institution             and the Chicago Poetry Center and on National Public Radio. He is presently             at work on an audio book of his translations of Iliad and Odyssey.

-=-=-TEXT: Main page » Audiobooks » War and peace- Leo Tolstoy (Audiobook) War and peace- Leo Tolstoy (Audiobook) Published by: toc xu (Karma: 202.31 ) on Yesterday, 18:05 | Views: 182 Share Often called the greatest novel ever written, War and Peace is at once an epic of the Napoleonic wars, a philosophical study, and a celebration of the Russian spirit. Tolstoy's genius is clearly seen in the multitude of characters in this massive chronicle, all of them fully realized and equally memorable. Out of this complex narrative emerges a profound examination of the individual's place in the historical process, one that makes it clear why Thomas Mann praised Tolstoy for his Homeric powers and placed War and Peace in the same category as The Iliad.The precise, mellifluous voice of Alexander Scourby, trained in Shakespearean roles in the 1930's and perfected in radio dramatic parts in the 1940's, became a well-known sound on Broadway, in motion pictures, and on television, where as Harriet Van Horne has observed, he is "the most sensitive and knowing narrator in the business." His most appreciative audience, however, is found among the nearly 80,000 borrowers of Talking Books, the recordings of literature produced under the supervision of the Division for the Blind of the Library of Congress for the use of the legally blind. Scourby, during his lifetime recorded over 500 books for the blind and has described his recording of Audio books as, "the one work that really means something to me."He is particularly well-remembered in the English-speaking world for his landmark recordings of the entire King James Version of the Bible.

-=-=-TEXT: Leave it to Tony-award winning actor Denis O’Hare* and visionary director Lisa Peterson to find a way to make the western world’s oldest extant work of literature not only intelligible, but immediate, relevant and eerily fascinating—like a barroom raconteur telling literally the oldest story in the book and making you believe it is being told for the first time. Gods and goddesses, weak-tendoned heroes and the face that launched a thousand ships…it’s all just another (incredibly engrossing) yarn in O’Hare* and Peterson’s one-man adaptation, developed at the Sundance Theatre Institute. 
 *Denis O’Hare is the co-creator of the piece but will not be the actor performing in the Portland Center Stage production. Joseph Graves will star in the Portland Center Stage production.
An Iliad runs approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes with no intermission. Please note that latecomers cannot be seated.
 As a modern retelling of an ancient tale, please note that this production includes strobe lights, theatrical haze, and some strong language.
 Set Design by William Bloodgood, Costume Design by Jeff Cone, Lighting Design by Diane Ferry Williams, and Sound Design by Sterling Tinsley.
If you want cheap seats at the Pearl District’s swanky Portland Center Stage Theater, you’ve got to dress up, find parking, and then linger around the front door of the theater until the Rush line opens just five minutes before showtime, hoping a couple of unsold seats remain. It’s a risk, but when you do get seats, it’s totally worth it. The other night, Brian and I did just this to catch a rendition of The Iliad.
We arrived about half an hour before the cheap seats were on sale, so Brian found the men’s room and I waited outside to get some fresh air before the tickets went on sale. 
At the front entrance, I had two choices of company-by-proximity to choose from: a high school girl smoking a cigarette, apparently on break from a pastry shop around the corner, or a homeless guy, muttering to himself and sitting on the sidewalk, similarly cigaretted. I chose the latter. I stood about a foot away from him, leaned on the brick wall at the entrance of the theater and took in a spoonful of ice cream from the Ben & Jerry’s we’d picked up across the street (sorry, Dad).  
The guy beside me wears a dingy red scarf and some finger-less mittens, and he fidgets with his cigarette. And he’s muttering. He’s muttering about how all the people walking past aren’t paying any attention to him. He’s not talking to me, per say, he’s just complaining. Couples are walking past, wearing tweed jackets and heels and boots, their eyes meeting mine at eye-level, trying not to look down at this mumbling man in their peripheral.
I want to cross into his world, though. Break through his plane of anonymity. I lean over and look him in the eye, sideways. “How ya doin?” I ask. 
Sometimes I cheat at being literate. Certain tomes are just too dense for me, so I find alternative ways to digest them. That’s why I was happy to recently see Portland Center Stage’s production An Iliad (on stage through November 21). I could finally enjoy the story of The Iliad without stopping every page or two, squinting and mumbling to keep the names straight.
Because, I’m sorry to say, I love the stories but have a hard time following the multisyllabic monikers and places from which they hail. I forget which maidens have been stolen from which conquests, and which gods are creating alliances with which other gods, who are all lackadaisically sticking a toe in to interfere now and then.
I was surprised to discover that this was a one-man show, and Joseph Graves was impressive in his range of voices and personalities. I am always amazed when one person can create for the audience images which keep our rapt attention. The heated battle scenes, especially, obscured the fact that I was watching a single actor, not two, or seven. 
This is what theater is suppose to be, engaging, serious, alive, even breathtaking and full of purpose. Rage is the beginning, an epic is told, but what is the human reality underlying the emotion and the history? Why do humans war? Strife raises its head and grows till it fills the sky, says our one man singer/storyteller. He asks repeatedly, do you see what I am saying? can you really see it? And no one can ignore what his words bring into the room. He makes us see even if we don’t want to look. The energy required to provide this performance is extraordinary—but Graves ran this marathon—a full hour and 45 minutes, non-stop, without skipping a beat, or resting in the process. This is a suburb piece of theater, beautifully done. 
Beneath the bulging muscle, the polished armor, the gleaming fleets and onlooking deities, The Iliad, Homer’s poem of the ugliest battle of the Trojan war, boils down to this: Dying fighting in defense of your country can be pretty fucking unseemly. This is especially true when your body is dragged by a chariot around the walls of your hometown, in full view of your wife—it’s not seemly at all.
This truth, in all its sadness and ugliness, is captured fairly well in An Iliad, a solo performance adapted by Denis O’Hare and Lisa Peterson from Robert Fagles’ translation of the poem. Here’s how it goes: A ragged storyteller stumbles onto the stage in what looks like a highway underpass, the stone walls inscribed with the names of millennia of soldiers. He is drunk, unkempt. He doesn’t seem to want to tell you his war stories, but he is compelled, possibly by the gods. And so he sings.

-=-=-TEXT: A couple of points:-
The string solution only covers the strings you know about, you are chasing the wind, if you look at the code of sip vicious (open source) that would be trivial to change, other more sophisticated scripts are being continually distributed. Fail2ban will catch much of that more sophisticated stuff than that if set up correctly. But you need to use it on all your other open services like postfix, ftp etc. and be equally effectively.
You DO actually need a firewall on your PBX, it needs to detect MITM attacks, port scanning, connection limiting and all the stuff the bad-guys use against you, simple allow/deny rules in iptables generally won't cut it.
The precursor to many attacks are IP addresses scrounged by drive-by attempts at your web server, (check your error logs for things like "phpmyadmin", "recordings" and anything below "admin" ) watch for attempts at your new, but now well known open web ports like 8*, it exposes a fingerprint of certain IP's that the scanners pass on to the attackers and generally they are not just script-kiddies, they are paying for those servers.
Blocking by GEO-IP no longer works, the Palestinians and the Chinese have moved to the likes of DataShack and Amazon ( Iliad and OVH for you Euros) . The OP's list was a hefty minority inside his own country.
Good idea to "only allow IP addresses" but in reality many external users will be DHCP'd by their provider, Cox or AT&T or whatever, you need to allow whole networks and many you will see are limited to local areas or next month they might not work, see my ip2route for that or do it manually with whois. Perhaps
for i in `rasterisk -x 'sip show peers'| grep -Eo '[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}'|sort -nu`;do ip2route $i;done >> /etc/csf/csf.allow
Before it appears, NO I don't think VPN's are a reasonable solution, you would have to explain to all your customers how to set up a VPN client on their Verizon FIOS or iPhone or Sonicwall or ATA , it won't happen.
But as far as reducing SIP attacks, and in general the most effective one, but
most folks miss is, "JUST DON'T BIND TO 50NN for SIP connections", they are guaranteed to be hit in minutes. There are more than 60000 safer choices.

My modification was to start taking into account the number of attempts from given subnets and to ban based on the number of past attempts. Hit me from one IP address and it gets banned, hit me from another IP in that subnet (up to a /16), and the subnet will get banned. Chinanet have pretty successfully firewalled themselves off using that technique, China Unicom aren't far behind and neither is Iliad Entreprises (France).

This lecture traces the history of Greek epics. It then examines the central themes of 'The Iliad': Xenia, Achilles' wrath, and his quest for immortality. The plot of 'The Iliad' is summarized and attention is drawn to themes from the Sumerian tradition.
As we learned in the Epic of Gilgamesh lecture, epic is the oldest surviving form of literature. By the time the Greeks had gotten their alphabet sorted out, people had been writing epics for over 2000 years. 
Perhaps the first things written in Greek were two epics, The Iliad and The Odyssey. Though the Greeks attributed these stories to the blind poet Homer, we're not even sure there ever was a Homer. It is likely the tales were centuries old before they were ever written down. 
They are mythologized tales of the bronze age, of Mycenae and Trojans. These epics probably began being told during the dark age that followed the Bronze Age collapse around 1200 B.C.E., when literacy had all but disappeared. They were transmitted via an oral tradition, told and retold, with parts added and parts forgotten until, finally, someone was able to write them down. 
Even in the written version, The Iliad and Odyssey retain signs of the oral tradition that forged them. The very fact that they are poems tells us that people were meant to recite these massive poems from memory. Unlike the Epic of Gilgamesh, which took up all of 12 tablets and totaled no more than 3,000 lines, The Odyssey is four times longer, with over 12,000 lines, while The Iliad is five times as long, containing 15,000 lines of verse. 
To aid in memory, the bards who recited these tales created formulaic stock phrases like 'He fell thunderously and his armor clattered upon him' and stock epithets for characters like 'brave Achilles' and 'clever Odysseus.' Even with these aids, it is hard to imagine someone memorizing a poem that would take days to recite in full. The fact that a people committed so long and nuanced a story to memory is a wonder in and of itself. 
So let us take a look at the first of these two epics: The Iliad. 
Despite its incredible length, The Iliad is really just about two things. First, the Greek concept of Xenia, or hospitality to strangers. And second, the Wrath of Achilles. The Trojan War is simply the setting for these concepts to play themselves out. 
The concept of Xenia is an unfamiliar one to modern audiences. It is essentially a divine law, governed by Zeus himself, that says you must offer hospitality to traveling strangers. This seems strange and dangerous to us. Yet in the ancient world, especially the Bronze Age world, and especially in the rugged mountains of Greece, it was not lone strangers who were dangerous, but the whole world. This was a time and place where laws extended no further than the sight of a city. Wild animals and bandits roamed the wilderness. And travelers had no guarantee of a bed to sleep in or a hot meal. There was no Motel 6 to 'leave the light on for them.' Shelter had to be found when and where it was available. 
Hence the incredible importance of Xenia in this age. Without the guarantee of hospitality along the way, no one would travel at all. The benefits of Xenia are not limited to the guest; the host gains as much as the guest from a visit: news of the outside world, a break in the monotony of daily life, and a friend abroad. 
That these guest- friendships meant something is evident from an exchange between two combatants on opposite sides of the Trojan War. Diomedes and Glaucus, upon reciting their lineages, realize that Glaucus' grandfather had once hosted Diomedes' grandfather as a guest. Based upon that ancient, generations-old friendship, the two agree not to fight each other. Glaucus even goes so far as to exchange his golden armor for Diomedes' bronze armor in token of that friendship. 
Yet though Xenia brought this Trojan and this Greek together, the same law of Xenia had started the Greek invasion in the first place. 
Paris, a prince of Troy, had claimed guest right, through Xenia, at the house of Menelaus, brother to Agamemnon, the King of Mycenae. Little did Menelaus know that his guest was planning to rob him, not of jewels or treasure, but of his wife. Menelaus' wife was none other than Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world. 
Paris had been promised Helen by the goddess Aphrodite, to sway his vote in a divine beauty pageant. (Don't believe me? Look up the myth of the golden apple.) Paris had come to the house of Menelaus to claim his prize. By running away with Helen, Paris had done more than violate the sanctity of Menelaus' marriage, he had abused the sacred bond between host and guest. Had Paris simply kidnapped Helen while she was out for a stroll, there likely would never have been a Trojan War. It was the fact that he committed this offence while a guest in Menelaus' house that demanded retribution. 
That is essentially how the Trojan War started. Yet The Iliad itself does not start with the story of Paris' violation of Xenia. 
The Iliad begins with the Wrath of Achilles. Indeed, 'wrath of Achilles' are the first words of the epic. 
So what is Achilles so angry about? Achilles is angry because he has to die. We all have trouble dealing with our own mortality, but we at least can take comfort in the fact that everybody dies. Achilles has no such comfort. 
Achilles has the goddess Thetis for a mother. As an immortal, Thetis will never grow old or die, but her son will. This upsets her, so she does everything she can to make her child immortal. When he was born, Thetis dipped the infant Achilles in the waters of her father, making him invulnerable everywhere but the heel where she held him. 
This invincibility, combined with his divine speed and strength, make Achilles the greatest warrior on the field. Yet despite all of her protection, Achilles remains mortal. And as a mortal, the closest thing to immortality Achilles can hope for is to earn eternal honor and fame. This harkens back to the Sumerian epic, in which Gilgamesh, distraught at losing the plant of youth, takes comfort in the fact that his legacy will live on in the city of Uruk. 
In short, with an immortal for a mother, Achilles is fixated on his own mortality. Yet honor is the only form of immortality available to mortal men. That is why he has come to Troy, to win honor and glory on the battlefield. 
Yet the leader of this expedition, Agamemnon, king of the great city of Mycenae, dishonors Achilles. As King of the Myrmidons, Achilles had claimed the Princess Briesis as a prize of war from an earlier battle. Agamemnon takes Briesis away from Achilles. Despite being a prisoner, Briesis is very upset at parting with Achilles, suggesting that the two really loved each other. 
Enraged by this affront to his dignity, Achilles refuses to fight. What good is dying for glory if his honor can be insulted by a man who is clearly his inferior? In his rage, Achilles cries to his mommy. 
Thetis is likewise upset at the mistreatment her baby must endure at the hands of his inferior. She complains to Zeus himself, who owes her a favor. Though Zeus is angry at the Trojans for violating Xenia, he agrees to let the Trojans defeat the Greeks, so long as Achilles refuses to fight, so that Agamemnon will have to appreciate Achilles and beg him to fight for them. To obtain eternal fame, Achilles must rescue the Greeks from the brink of destruction and lead them to victory. 
Zeus is true to his word. To ensure the destruction and slaughter of the Greeks, he sends Agamemnon a false dream, prophesying the easy destruction of the Trojans at the hands of the Greeks. This is a big break from the Sumerian tradition in the Epic of Gilgamesh, in which dreams are always true, if correctly interpreted. 
Emboldened by his dream, Agamemnon begins a disastrous assault on Troy, that ends up with the Trojans fighting the Greeks all the way back to their boats. Fearing defeat, Agamemnon sends an envoy with a peace offering to Achilles, but Achilles rejects the apology. 
Desperate to turn the tide, Achilles' comrade (and lover), Patroclus dons Achilles armor and leads the Myrmidons in the hope that the Trojans will think him Achilles and take flight. Though the Trojans are not fooled, Patroclus' killing spree still drives the Trojans back to their own walls. In the end, Patroclus is killed by Hector, who takes Achilles' fine armor as a trophy. 
Achilles does not take Patroclus' death well. He is beset with grief and self-loathing, knowing that his own hateful pride had brought about his lover's death. The Greeks call a cease fire for both sides to care for their dead, which the Trojans accept. After a series of funeral games, and appeals from his compatriots and Agamemnon, Achilles finally agrees to return to the battlefield, not to repay the insult done Menelaus, but to avenge Patroclus. 
Yet just when he decides to fight, he finds himself without any armor or weapons. Time to cry to mommy again. This time Thetis outdoes herself. She gets Hephaistos, the god of the forge, to make Achilles the most beautiful set of armor he has ever seen. The shield alone takes more than a hundred lines to describe. 
Before she departs, Achilles' mother tells him that if he continues to fight, he will die on the shores of Troy, but achieve eternal glory. If he refrains from fighting, he will live a long life but one of obscurity. Given the choice between a long life of no note, and a short one of eternal glory, Achilles chooses to fight. He does not fear death. He fears being forgotten. 
Decked out with his marvelous armor, and happy to die for glory, Achilles goes on a rampage. He kills off the greatest Trojans and their allies one by one, including a several demigods and a river, until, at last, he is confronted by Hector. 
Yet seeing Achilles unbridled rage, Hector is terrified and flees to the walls of Troy. Apollo distracts Achilles by assuming Hector's form, and leads Achilles on a merry chase. 
But Hector does not hide inside the walls of Troy. Despite calls from his friends and family, he decides to stay outside and confront Achilles. Yet he loses his nerve when Achilles, now madder than hell at having been fooled by Apollo, comes bearing down on him. 
Hector flees. Achilles chases Hector around the walls of Troy, until Athena, disguised as Hector's brother, convinces Hector to turn and fight Achilles with his brother at his side. Of course, as soon as Achilles arrives, Athena vanishes, and Hector knows he is alone and he's going to die. 
Yet he faces his death bravely. After a fierce duel, Hector falls. To add insult to injury, Achilles then drags the dead Hector around behind his chariot, and refuses to relinquish the tattered body to Hector's father Priam. It takes the combined efforts of gods and men to make Achilles relent. The Iliad ends with the funeral of Hector. 
Throughout The Illiad, the Trojans are portrayed as just as valiant, just as noble, just as good as the Greeks. The king of Troy, Priam, is wise and fair. His son Hector was just as terrifying to the Greeks as Achilles was to the Trojans. The funeral service highlights the nobility and greatness of Hector and the Trojans. 
This ending reflects a basic Greek sentiment: there is no honor in defeating a dishonorable enemy. In fact, the only rotten apple among the Trojans is Paris, who is more of a lover than a fighter, and spends much of his time whining about the unfairness of Aphrodite for promising him a woman with such dangerous strings attached to her. 
Yet the story of Achilles does not end with The Illiad. 
With Hector dead, the fate of Troy was all but decided. Yet Achilles would not get to see it fall. As Thetis promised, Achilles did not survive Hector long. Yet to his death, Achilles remained unbeaten in single combat. It was not an honorable duel that ended the life of Achilles. Instead it was an arrow, fired by the cowardly Paris and guided by Apollo that brought the great hero down by striking his one vulnerable spot, his heel. After a fierce battle over Achilles' body, his corpse was brought to his camp, cremated, and placed in the same urn as Patroclus, while the Greeks held competitions for his magnificent armor. 
Thus died the great warrior Achilles. It is fitting that an epic dedicated to Achilles' struggle against mortality does not depict his death and tawdry funeral. Instead, The Iliad ends with Achilles triumphant, honored and gloriously alive. In The Iliad, Achilles achieved the immortality he so fervently desired. And in his wrath, he made the people of Troy pay the penalty for their prince's violation of Xenia.

"In the Iliad, Homer has Apollo Smintheus bring the plague to the Greeks as a punishment for Agamemnos’s arrogance toward Chryse, the god’s high priest. Apollo’s temple was built at Chryse in the territory of Hamaxitos, one of the cities from which the original population of Alexandria came from. The statue of Apollo, sculpted by the great Parian, shows Apollo standing with a mouse at his feet."

The Iliad is an epic historical account written in verse and attributed to an author we today call Homer. Some specialists consider Homer to have been a woman or a committee or a random collection of legends, but mainstream tradition regards him as a man, probably illiterate and possibly blind, living along the western coast of what is today Turkey.
The Iliad is considered to be one of the earliest masterworks of world literature, and it was enormously influential in Greek and Roman thought and in all the later societies influenced by the Classical Mediterranean world. Many college courses incorporate the Iliad for these reasons.
  Marble Bust of Homer (Roman, AD 2). The haircut is funny-looking, even for a Roman statue, but (1) some people like funny-looking hair, and (2) there is no reason to believe Homer actually looked anything like this.    
It is also an important historical source for our understanding of the age of Homer (about 800 BC) and of the events he seems to describe (about 1200 BC). This introduction is designed to help you interpret Homer’s Iliad as a cultural and historical document, but generally ignores its literary significance, although that is the focus of most college courses in which it is introduced. The presentation here consists of four main parts: 
Parts 1-3 deal with the story itself. Homer assumes that his audience will already be familiar with many of the characters in his story, and with the events that preceded and followed it. The historical and mythological events that precede the story are laid out in Part 1. Part 2 is a synopsis of the book. Part 3 discusses what happened at Troy after the close of the Iliad, including the story of the famous Trojan Horse.
Part 4 is more modern. Modern readers want to know how much of the story is true. Did the Trojan War happen? Why? How accurate was Homer’s account? How can we know? What has been found at the archaeological site of Troy? 
A critical fact is that, at about the same time Troy fell to the Greeks (if that is what happened), pretty much every other large human settlement in the region also was destroyed and/or abandoned, so “the Trojan War” for the historian makes sense only as (1) a part of the folklore of later Greeks and (2) part of a regional cataclysm that must be understood in much broader terms than those invoked by Homer. Some of these questions are discussed in Part 4.
Part 5 (an appendix) is a list of the principal players in the Iliad. There are lots of them, so it makes life easier to have a reference list. If you use this handbook while you read the Iliad, I recommend that you read the introduction to the list and look through it before you start reading, and then use it afterward if you get confused about who is who. If you are content with a quick overview of the book, you probably don't need it. If you are preparing for an exam, you may want to use a flash-card version of it (link). 
Part 6 is a list of questions and answers about the Iliad. How these questions came to be and what they seek to accomplish are laid out in the introduction to Part 6. They were originally intended to be read immediately after reading the corresponding chapter. They do not focus on character development, dramatic descriptions, or literary manipulations of the material (all of which are fascinating). Instead they direct attention to matters in which the Iliad can help us understand the society of Homer or of the Mycenaeans, or in which Homer or the Mycenaeans can help us understand other peoples (including ourselves). 
A problem with these questions is that they are hard. After I composed them, I found that often I could not answer them, especially if I let a little time slip by between reading a chapter and approaching its questions. The reason is that the questions focus on some quite small details because these are where many of the clues lie about what Mycenaean life was like or about how reliable an account Homer is giving of it. Remember that for purposes of this site, you are not reading the Iliad as a work of literature, and these notes do not treat it from a literary perspective. If you are not reading the Iliad, but are using these notes only for the background information and the synopsis, you will probably not be able to make much use of Part 6. (Most of them cannot be answered from the story-line summary provided in part 2.)
Chronology. It is useful to have some sense of the order of events in the Greek world. A relatively simple one is available on this web site. (Link)
Over the years this essay has been read and improved by too many students and colleagues for me to enumerate them here. Although I keep introducing new errors and stubbornly retain some of the old ones, I am grateful for the many improvements that have been proposed and especially for the many that I have been able to incorporate. Thanks to you all.

The Iliad, together with the Odyssey, is one of two ancient Greek epic poems traditionally attributed to Homer. The poem is commonly dated to the 8th or 7th century BC, and many scholars believe it is the oldest extant work of literature in the Greek language, making it the first work of European literature. The existence of a single author for the poems is disputed as the poems themselves show evidence of a long oral tradition and hence, multiple authors. The poem concerns events during the tenth and final year in the siege of the city of Iliun, or Troy, by the Greeks. (Summary adapted from Wikipedia by Karen Merline.)

 Quote: : Hey, I it's been two years since I studied Cicero. Probably my favourite module across AS and A level, although it was my lowest scoring (86):/
I pretty much ignored the letters and focused on Verres, as it is pretty hard to know the context for 20-something letters.
Basically you have to know ciceros life thoroughly. Be careful with dates, as questions often specify a time period.
You'll know the main events better than I would, but the major ones I can remember are: trial of Roscius + Verres, quaestorship, aedileship, praetorship, relationship with Pompey, consulship + catilinarian conspiracy, trial of rabirius, 1st triumvirate, civil war, Caesar, clodius, conference of Luca, ciceros exile, 2nd triumvirate, etc..
There's loads more that I cant remember, but my teacher gave awesome notes. So if you need any help hit me up, cause I'm just working for a year before uni. I also did the iliad(98), the Aeneid(97), and the Persians(95). What other modules do you study for AS/A level?

Denis is married to Hugo Redwood, an interior designer, with whom he has a son.
The Iliad (800 B.C.) vs. An Iliad (2012)
As Alaskans well know, storytelling comes in many forms. Take the story of The Iliad, for example. In Ancient Greece, Homer’s epic poem was sung by a poet. In fact, the poet never memorized the entire song, but instead he would make it up on the spot following only two rules: 1) the essential story and 2) the keeping of memorized descriptions (examples: “strong-greaved Achaeans” or “long-haired Achaeans”) that help to keep the meter of the poem. The poet also used an accompaniment of a lyre to help tell the poem.  Today we are telling the story using the tool of theatre, specifically a one-person show.  A one-person show is essentially a performance in which only one actor is driving the story, through monologues or monopolylogue—which is when the actor takes the role of many characters and carries on a conversation. In An Iliad, you will notice that there are two people on stage: the actor/poet and the musician. The musician is the muse that gives inspiration and fuel for the poet to continue to tell this story, both today and three thousand years ago.
The Art of Storytelling
Because of the three thousand year difference and because there is no solid evidence behind it, people continue to question whether or not the Trojan War actually took place, whether Homer even composed either The Iliad and The Odyssey, and whether or not a man named Homer ever existed. Studies have shown so many different answers to these questions that no one can say for certain the credibility of these stories. However, even after the uncertainties, people still continue to tell Homer’s story. Why? Because the story of this three-thousand year war is still relevant to today’s audience, and will continue to be passed on through the art of storytelling.
An Iliad started out as an examination of war and of man’s tendency toward war. In the end, it also became an examination of the theater and the way in which we still tell each other stories in order to try to make sense of ourselves, and our behavior. Someone started telling the story of the Trojan War, in all its glory and devastation and surprise, over 3,000 years ago. We pass it on. (Patterson and O’Hare’s Preface Note, An Illiad)
After all, a classic is a classic because it remains modern.

-=-=-TEXT:  Thetis goes to the palace of Vulcan to obtain new arms for her son.   "Thee, welcome, goddess! what occasion calls (So long a stranger) to these honour'd walls? 'Tis thine, fair Thetis, the command to lay, And Vulcan's joy and duty to obey."  To whom the mournful mother thus replies: (The crystal drops stood trembling in her eyes:) "O Vulcan! say, was ever breast divine So pierced with sorrows, so o'erwhelm'd as mine? Of all the goddesses, did Jove prepare For Thetis only such a weight of care? I, only I, of all the watery race By force subjected to a man's embrace, Who, sinking now with age and sorrow, pays The mighty fine imposed on length of days. Sprung from my bed, a godlike hero came, The bravest sure that ever bore the name; Like some fair plant beneath my careful hand He grew, he flourish'd, and he graced the land: To Troy I sent him! but his native shore Never, ah never, shall receive him more; (Even while he lives, he wastes with secret woe;) Nor I, a goddess, can retard the blow! Robb'd of the prize the Grecian suffrage gave, The king of nations forced his royal slave: For this he grieved; and, till the Greeks oppress'd Required his arm, he sorrow'd unredress'd. Large gifts they promise, and their elders send; In vain--he arms not, but permits his friend His arms, his steeds, his forces to employ: He marches, combats, almost conquers Troy: Then slain by Phoebus (Hector had the name) At once resigns his armour, life, and fame. But thou, in pity, by my prayer be won: Grace with immortal arms this short-lived son, And to the field in martial pomp restore, To shine with glory, till he shines no more!"  To her the artist-god: "Thy griefs resign, Secure, what Vulcan can, is ever thine. O could I hide him from the Fates, as well, Or with these hands the cruel stroke repel, As I shall forge most envied arms, the gaze Of wondering ages, and the world's amaze!"  Thus having said, the father of the fires To the black labours of his forge retires. Soon as he bade them blow, the bellows turn'd Their iron mouths; and where the furnace burn'd, Resounding breathed: at once the blast expires, And twenty forges catch at once the fires; Just as the god directs, now loud, now low, They raise a tempest, or they gently blow; In hissing flames huge silver bars are roll'd, And stubborn brass, and tin, and solid gold; Before, deep fix'd, the eternal anvils stand; The ponderous hammer loads his better hand, His left with tongs turns the vex'd metal round, And thick, strong strokes, the doubling vaults rebound.  Then first he form'd the immense and solid shield; Rich various artifice emblazed the field; Its utmost verge a threefold circle bound; A silver chain suspends the massy round; Five ample plates the broad expanse compose, And godlike labours on the surface rose. There shone the image of the master-mind: There earth, there heaven, there ocean he design'd; The unwearied sun, the moon completely round; The starry lights that heaven's high convex crown'd; The Pleiads, Hyads, with the northern team; And great Orion's more refulgent beam; To which, around the axle of the sky, The Bear, revolving, points his golden eye, Still shines exalted on the ethereal plain, Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main.  Two cities radiant on the shield appear, The image one of peace, and one of war. Here sacred pomp and genial feast delight, And solemn dance, and hymeneal rite; Along the street the new-made brides are led, With torches flaming, to the nuptial bed: The youthful dancers in a circle bound To the soft flute, and cithern's silver sound: Through the fair streets the matrons in a row Stand in their porches, and enjoy the show.  There in the forum swarm a numerous train; The subject of debate, a townsman slain: One pleads the fine discharged, which one denied, And bade the public and the laws decide: The witness is produced on either hand: For this, or that, the partial people stand: The appointed heralds still the noisy bands, And form a ring, with sceptres in their hands: On seats of stone, within the sacred place, The reverend elders nodded o'er the case; Alternate, each the attesting sceptre took, And rising solemn, each his sentence spoke Two golden talents lay amidst, in sight, The prize of him who best adjudged the right.  Another part (a prospect differing far)(255) Glow'd with refulgent arms, and horrid war. Two mighty hosts a leaguer'd town embrace, And one would pillage, one would burn the place. Meantime the townsmen, arm'd with silent care, A secret ambush on the foe prepare: Their wives, their children, and the watchful band Of trembling parents, on the turrets stand. They march; by Pallas and by Mars made bold: Gold were the gods, their radiant garments gold, And gold their armour: these the squadron led, August, divine, superior by the head! A place for ambush fit they found, and stood, Cover'd with shields, beside a silver flood. Two spies at distance lurk, and watchful seem If sheep or oxen seek the winding stream. Soon the white flocks proceeded o'er the plains, And steers slow-moving, and two shepherd swains; Behind them piping on their reeds they go, Nor fear an ambush, nor suspect a foe. In arms the glittering squadron rising round Rush sudden; hills of slaughter heap the ground; Whole flocks and herds lie bleeding on the plains, And, all amidst them, dead, the shepherd swains! The bellowing oxen the besiegers hear; They rise, take horse, approach, and meet the war, They fight, they fall, beside the silver flood; The waving silver seem'd to blush with blood. There Tumult, there Contention stood confess'd; One rear'd a dagger at a captive's breast; One held a living foe, that freshly bled With new-made wounds; another dragg'd a dead; Now here, now there, the carcases they tore: Fate stalk'd amidst them, grim with human gore. And the whole war came out, and met the eye; And each bold figure seem'd to live or die.  A field deep furrow'd next the god design'd, The third time labour'd by the sweating hind; The shining shares full many ploughmen guide, And turn their crooked yokes on every side. Still as at either end they wheel around, The master meets them with his goblet crown'd; The hearty draught rewards, renews their toil, Then back the turning ploughshares cleave the soil: Behind, the rising earth in ridges roll'd; And sable look'd, though form'd of molten gold.  Another field rose high with waving grain; With bended sickles stand the reaper train: Here stretched in ranks the levell'd swarths are found, Sheaves heap'd on sheaves here thicken up the ground. With sweeping stroke the mowers strow the lands; The gatherers follow, and collect in bands; And last the children, in whose arms are borne (Too short to gripe them) the brown sheaves of corn. The rustic monarch of the field descries, With silent glee, the heaps around him rise. A ready banquet on the turf is laid, Beneath an ample oak's expanded shade. The victim ox the sturdy youth prepare; The reaper's due repast, the woman's care.  Next, ripe in yellow gold, a vineyard shines, Bent with the ponderous harvest of its vines; A deeper dye the dangling clusters show, And curl'd on silver props, in order glow: A darker metal mix'd intrench'd the place; And pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace. To this, one pathway gently winding leads, Where march a train with baskets on their heads, (Fair maids and blooming youths,) that smiling bear The purple product of the autumnal year. To these a youth awakes the warbling strings, Whose tender lay the fate of Linus sings; In measured dance behind him move the train, Tune soft the voice, and answer to the strain.  Here herds of oxen march, erect and bold, Rear high their horns, and seem to low in gold, And speed to meadows on whose sounding shores A rapid torrent through the rushes roars: Four golden herdsmen as their guardians stand, And nine sour dogs complete the rustic band. Two lions rushing from the wood appear'd; And seized a bull, the master of the herd: He roar'd: in vain the dogs, the men withstood; They tore his flesh, and drank his sable blood. The dogs (oft cheer'd in vain) desert the prey, Dread the grim terrors, and at distance bay.  Next this, the eye the art of Vulcan leads Deep through fair forests, and a length of meads, And stalls, and folds, and scatter'd cots between; And fleecy flocks, that whiten all the scene.  A figured dance succeeds; such once was seen In lofty Gnossus for the Cretan queen, Form'd by Daedalean art; a comely band Of youths and maidens, bounding hand in hand. The maids in soft simars of linen dress'd; The youths all graceful in the glossy vest: Of those the locks with flowery wreath inroll'd; Of these the sides adorn'd with swords of gold, That glittering gay, from silver belts depend. Now all at once they rise, at once descend, With well-taught feet: now shape in oblique ways, Confusedly regular, the moving maze: Now forth at once, too swift for sight, they spring, And undistinguish'd blend the flying ring: So whirls a wheel, in giddy circle toss'd, And, rapid as it runs, the single spokes are lost. The gazing multitudes admire around: Two active tumblers in the centre bound; Now high, now low, their pliant limbs they bend: And general songs the sprightly revel end.  Thus the broad shield complete the artist crown'd With his last hand, and pour'd the ocean round: In living silver seem'd the waves to roll, And beat the buckler's verge, and bound the whole.  This done, whate'er a warrior's use requires He forged; the cuirass that outshone the fires, The greaves of ductile tin, the helm impress'd With various sculpture, and the golden crest. At Thetis' feet the finished labour lay: She, as a falcon cuts the aerial way, Swift from Olympus' snowy summit flies, And bears the blazing present through the skies.

-=-=-TITLE: A Dose of Nuance: Triggers we can do without - Opinion - Jerusalem Post
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT:  It’s been many years since I completed my studies at New York City’s Columbia University, but I still occasionally read the student newspaper, The Spectator, to get a sense of what’s going on.
Columbia is a great place – it was then, and it is now (despite some faculty members’ reprehensible attitude to Israel) – and as I read The Spec, as we called it back then, I often grow wistful about the world I left when we moved to Israel almost two decades ago.
Recently, however, an article in The Spec reminded me not of what a great educational experience Columbia was (though it certainly was), but how much healthier Israeli society is (at least in some ways) than its American counterpart. The column “Our identities matter in core classrooms” was about the increasingly discussed issue of “trigger warnings” that students are demanding in college courses.
What’s a trigger warning? Here is the language of four Columbia students: “During the week spent on Ovid’s Metamorphoses, the class was instructed to read the myths of Persephone and Daphne, both of which include vivid depictions of rape and sexual assault. As a survivor of sexual assault, [a] student described being triggered while reading such detailed accounts of rape throughout the work. However, the student said her professor focused on the beauty of the language and the splendor of the imagery when lecturing on the text. As a result, the student completely disengaged.”
See the latest opinion pieces on our Opinion & Blogs Facebook page
So, what do the students want? They want to be warned. About scenes with sexual violence. About scenes with racist overtones. About scenes with misogynistic language. They want to be prepared emotionally for the trauma that reading great works of literature can entail.
The demand is becoming so widespread that The New York Times actually devoted space to an entire debate on the subject (“Restraint of expression on college campuses”) a year ago.
As I read the new column in The Spec, though, I was reminded of several moments at Shalem College, here in Jerusalem, where the intellectual atmosphere is entirely different. And healthier. I remembered, for example, a moment in October 2013, when I sat in on a class in which our students were reading The Iliad. They came to a war scene in one of the last of The Iliad’s 24 books, and one student remarked, “The Greek reader had to know that Homer’s description of war here isn’t realistic. This is an airbrushed description of war; this isn’t what war is like.”
Suddenly, it was silent in the room.
Twenty-five students, sitting with an ancient Greek text translated into Hebrew, sat immobile. I looked at their faces, especially the faces of the men. That seemingly innocent comment about Homer’s description of war not being realistic had taken them to a very different place. They had been transported – to a different setting, far from books, far from the calm and security of a college classroom, far from the rarefied world of Homeric texts.
The professor, a fabulous teacher, knew better than to say anything. He allowed the silence to persist – like a mist that needed time to clear – and then, in a soft tone, said nothing about the comment and simply continued the discussion.
I listened carefully to what followed.
There were people there, I knew, who had been traumatized by what they’d experienced in the army. (A few months later, one of those students actually received a medal for extraordinary bravery.) There were people who had lost friends.
Yet there was no sense that these students wanted to be protected from the texts. Their experiences had made them stronger, not more fragile. Their past, painful as it had been, did not lead them to shy away from reading Homer – rather, it enriched their reading of The Iliad.
From what they had lived through, they learned that their lives – their hopes, the things they dread, their dreams and nightmares – made them part of a conversation that has been unfolding for thousands of years.
They understand that the reason we read Homer, and Bible, and Talmud, and modern literature, at Shalem College is to weave their pasts – the pleasant as well as the challenging – into the tapestry of what great and majestic cultures have been saying about these issues for centuries.
We shared with our students at Shalem this newfound American demand for “trigger warnings,” and they were simply perplexed. What’s the point of learning, they asked, if we’re going to shy away from the issues that are most critical? Why read these texts if, precisely when they evoke powerful emotions, we’re going to hunker down in fear? It was the reaction I’d expected – and the reaction I’d hoped they’d have.
This is a country in which it is easy to worry about the kids we’re producing.
Too many of them are too boisterous, too many of them don’t know how to stand in line, how to board a plane politely, how to listen to those with whom they disagree and respect those whose life-choices are different from their own. All true. But there is a slice of Israeli society, it behooves us to recall, that has internalized the stressful and often frightening reality of Israeli life in order to become deeper, more thoughtful, more nuanced and more open.
The world we cherish will not be preserved by running from conflict or shielding ourselves from the uncomfortable.
There is evil in the world, and too often, the West is unprepared to call that evil what it is. There are forces that wish to destroy everything we stand for, and too often, the West is unprepared to stand up to them, to draw lines in the sand, to make it clear we believe in certain values, in particular principles, and we’ll sacrifice for them.
We live in a world bereft of Churchills and Roosevelts. Yet we also live in a country that has produced an extraordinary young generation. We cannot yet know precisely how, but there’s every reason to believe that when people look back on what saved Israel in the early part of the 21st century, it will have been in large measure a generation of young people not afraid to face their fears, a generation willing to face their pasts.
It will likely have been due to a generation of Israelis who understand that it is only when we are disturbed, shaken and unsettled that we are poised to do truly great things.
The writer is senior vice president, Koret Distinguished Fellow and chair of the core curriculum at Jerusalem’s Shalem College, Israel’s first liberal arts college. His latest book is Menachem Begin: The Battle for Israel’s Soul; he is now writing a concise history of the State of Israel.

BLOODY but beautiful, is there a greater poem than the “Iliad”? Depicting a few weeks in the final year of the Greek siege of Troy, Homer's epic glitters with bronze spears and the blazing sun. Rich with his famous similes and repeated expressions, it describes a war in which men can pause from fighting in order to speak of their family lineage in terms of “As is the generation of leaves, so is that of humanity”; in which Gods can yank warriors back by their hair or cover them in a cloud of mist if it is not yet their turn to die. It is both brutally realistic (once you have heard how Phereclus died by a spear through his right buttock into his bladder, you won't forget it) and belonging to another world—as the Greek epithet for Homer, theois aoidos or “divine singer” suggests. It is no wonder that the “Iliad” is a text that people constantly turn back to, and continually translate.
And yet, it comes as something of a surprise that this month there are four translations competing for the status of a definitive “Iliad”. Richmond Lattimore's translation, originally from 1951, has been reissued with scholarly notes and a new introduction. For years, Lattimore's version has been a standard text, particularly in his native America. It is not hard to see why. Both lucid and learned, Lattimore writes with a certain grace, capturing the combination of nobility and speed which over 100 years ago Matthew Arnold famously heard in Homer's work.
In certain respects, both Stephen Mitchell and Anthony Verity are setting their versions against Lattimore's. Mr Verity, a former Master of Dulwich College in London, declares that his translation “does not claim to be poetry.” Mr Mitchell, a translator who had little Greek before starting out on this project, claims that his version is more reliable as he bases it on a different edition of the text from Lattimore's. By doing so, Mr Mitchell cuts what has, for centuries, been included in the performance tradition of the “Iliad”. Gone is the whole of Book Ten (“baroque and nasty”, apparently), most of the adjectives and fixed epithets that contribute to the life of Homer's figures and, subsequently, most of the poetic value of Homer's work. It is doubtful, for example, that Zeus, the father of the universe, would ever exclaim as Mr Mitchell has him do, that “I have a sensible plan”, or even that Achilles, tempestuous as he is, would rally “To hell with that man…I don't give a damn about him.”
Similarly, although Mr Verity is far more restrained and scholarly in his translation, he too fails to capture the full force of Homer's work. In Mr Verity's translation, Achilles's outburst above becomes the prim “I abominate his gifts, and I value him no more than a splinter.” Such differences may seem slight in comparison, but the accumulated result, whether of Mr Mitchell's colloquialisms or Mr Verity's carefulness, render these both rather dull literary works. Both Mr Verity and Mr Mitchell give Hecuba's speech to her husband, Priam, when he tells her of going to retrieve their son Hector's body from Achilles, a certain shrillness not necessarily heard in the Greek. “Good God! Are you out of your mind?” wails Mr Mitchell's version, while Mr Verity's is similarly brusque: “You are mad! Where has your good sense gone…” In contrast, Lattimore captures something far nearer to the original, a mother mourning her son's death: “Ah me, where has that wisdom gone for which you were famous?” Homer's epic is not just composed of harridan wives and brave men. It encompasses the whole messy breadth of humanity, and so needs a decent translation to bring this about.
Paradoxically, Alice Oswald manages to achieve this, even if her “Memorial” is about an eighth of the length of the “Iliad”. Ms Oswald has audaciously set out to translate the book's atmosphere, rather than its story. A poet known for her landscape verse, Ms Oswald read classics at Oxford. The result is a work by someone who not only understands Homer's Greek, but who also has an ear for modern verse. It is a delight to read. Although some of the best-loved moments in Homer's text are referred to only obliquely or fleetingly—when Achilles, mourning, covers his face in earth at the news of the death of his companion, Patroclus, or when Andromache is seen running a bath for an already-dead Hector—Ms Oswald has captured a certain spirit of Homer's text, preventing the reader from missing these narrative moments too much.
Ms Oswald translates Homer's similes literally, but paraphrases the rest, creating a modernised version that delights in the unexpected. She brings the poem's violence shockingly to life: a figure dies as quickly as “a lift door closing”, suddenly obscured from view, while another soldier, stripping the dead, has “tin-opened them out of their armour”. Diomedes kills “Red-faced quietly like a butcher keeping up with his order”. Ms Oswald is aware that these characters can at times seem more horrific than heroic: “This is horrible this is some kind of bloodfeast”. And Hector waits for Achilles, “Like a man rushing in leaving his motorbike running”, both arrogant and charming at once.
Ms Oswald's “Memorial” strips the “Iliad” down to its bare bones, capturing the terrifying brevity and brutality of the deaths (240 named, many more anonymous) that Homer depicted. With no gods in her version, it could seem rather bleak. And yet there is a liveliness to her poem—part elegy, part war memorial—that prevents it from becoming so. Read Richmond Lattimore's translation for the epic scale and narrative of Homer's poem. But read Alice Oswald in order to be reminded how such an everlasting work can still shock, even in the 21st century.

-=-=-TITLE: Mobile operators plan to block ads
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: Mobile operators plan to block online advertising Robert Cookson, Digital Media Correspondent ©Getty 
Several mobile operators plan to block advertising on their networks, setting the stage for a battle with digital media companies such as Google , AOL and Yahoo . 
One European wireless carrier told the Financial Times that it has installed blocking software in its data centres and planned to turn it on before the end of 2015. More Qatar’s ambitions struggle on US screens 
The software prevents most types of advertising from loading in web pages and apps, though it does not interfere with “in-feed” ads of the kind used by Facebook and Twitter. 
The blocking technology was developed by Shine, an Israeli start-up whose shareholders include Horizon Ventures, the investment fund of Li Ka-shing, Asia’s richest person. 
Mr Li also controls Hutchison Whampoa, one of the world’s largest telecoms groups. 
“Tens of millions of mobile subscribers around the world will be opting in to ad blocking by the end of the year,” said Roi Carthy, chief marketing officer of Shine. “If this scales, it could have a devastating impact on the online advertising industry.” 
Verizon, the largest US telecoms group, this week paid $4.4bn to buy AOL , seeking to gain a foothold in the rapidly growing market for advertising on mobile devices . 
Marketers will spend almost $69bn this year on mobile ads — more than triple the sum they spent two years ago — according to research group eMarketer. 
Shine said it was working with a number of operators, including one with almost 40m subscribers, though it declined to name them. 
An executive at a European carrier confirmed that it and several of its peers are planning to start blocking adverts this year. 
The executive said that the carrier will initially launch an advertising-free service for customers on an opt-in basis. 
But it is also considering a more radical idea that it calls “the bomb”, which would apply across its entire network of millions of subscribers at once. The idea is to specifically target Google, blocking advertising on its websites in an attempt to force the company into giving up a cut of its revenues. 
What are adblockers? Software that prevents advertisements from loading in web pages or apps. Blockers use a predetermined blacklist to determine what type of ads are blocked and on what sites. They also adjusts a page’s layout so that it looks normal after the ads have been removed. 
Why do people block ads? Common motivations are to eliminate intrusive advertising such as pop-ups and to improve the appearance of web pages by removing clutter. For users of mobile devices, loading a web page is also faster when the adverts have been removed. Blockers also reduce the risk of a computer being hijacked by malware that is sometimes distributed through ad networks. Lastly, blockers can protect privacy by preventing websites from collecting user data. 
What are the downsides? One irritation for users is that ad blockers sometimes block too much content and interfere with the normal loading of a web page. Blockers also consume computer resources. For online publishers, ad blockers are an existential threat. Given that most free services rely on advertising, the spread of blocking threatens to upend the economics of the internet. 
The Silicon Valley company is the world’s largest advertising business, generating $60bn a year from search, YouTube, and services such as Google Display Network and DoubleClick, which both deliver ads for third-party sites. 
The executive at the mobile operator considering “the bomb” acknowledged that targeting Google could be risky from both a legal and public relations perspective. Under “net neutrality” rules in the European Union and the US, telecoms companies are forced to treat all data that flow through their networks equally. 
But even within those markets, it would be feasible to block adverts on Google “just for an hour or a day” to bring the company to the negotiating table, the executive said. 
Many mobile operators are frustrated that digital media companies profit from their high-speed networks without having to invest in the infrastructure behind them. Such irritation was inflamed last month when Google launched Project Fi , its own wireless carrier in the US. 
Google said that it would be unreasonable for mobile operators to block ads, arguing that: “People pay for mobile internet packages so they can access the apps, video streaming, webmail and other services they love, many of which are funded by ads. Google and other web companies invest heavily in developing these services — and in the behind-the-scenes infrastructure to deliver them.” 
Blocking advertising on mobile networks is likely to provoke a fierce backlash from digital media companies. In 2013, Free, the French internet service provider owned by Iliad , blocked ads by default through its Freebox modem, causing huge controversy. It was forced to scrap the initiative within a week under pressure from the Socialist government. 
Mr Carthy of Shine said that eliminating intrusive adverts is a “consumer right”, even if it undermines the business model of online publishers that rely on advertising. 
“Online advertising is out of control and it’s polluting the user experience,” he said. Pop-ups, auto-playing videos and other forms of digital advertising can consume between 10 and 50 per cent of a mobile subscriber’s data plan, he added. 
While ad-blocking is a new phenomenon on mobiles, it is more established on PCs and growing quickly. More than 140m people, or 5 per cent of the online population, use software such as Adblock Plus to eliminate adverts when browsing the web on laptops or desktop computers. 
As the Financial Times reported in February, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have paid the makers of Adblock Plus to allow some ads on their sites to slip through its filters. 
Google’s relationship with ad-blocking is further complicated by the fact that such software is the most popular type of free add-on to Chrome, its popular web browser. Related Topics

-=-=-TITLE:  What The Boy Next Door Thinks a First Edition of The <b>Iliad</b> Looks Like
-=-=-SNIPPET:  s nThe Iliad was likely written around 762 B.C. Here
-=-=-TEXT: America's military castes love to call themselves warriors. Moreover, national security keyboard artists have found their true rhetorical love comparing ancient Greek hoplites to our own "warrior" panoplies of war, as though we share the same battle-mettle -- and the same frames of strategic choice and action -- Would war with China be like the Iliad ? Or would it be like the Peloponnesian War ?
This tendency is a mistake, for two reasons. The first is that we do not resemble ancient Greeks (and that should be cause for celebration). The second is that there are men today who do, completely ...
... and they are our sworn enemies, the enemies of civilization itself.
The beheading of James Foley is our warning that we face the forces of Homer -- real warriors from a heroic age -- and that is bad news. But the worse news will come if we persist in denying it.
No one will deny that we are the remote posterity of Bronze Age fighters. But it then took us 3000 years to rediscover writing, create philosophy and science and history, and also democracy. We still burned girls as witches 300 years ago, and 150 years ago millions of Americans were still no more than high-value chattel property.
We have emerged as better humans only very recently. Civilization is at last becoming a world where we all belong to each other, like our ancestral DNA shows. 
But Homer's world was very different. It is a world defined by human difference. This is the world humans built for themselves for hundreds of thousands of years -- years in which humanity was all about the celebration of difference.
In this world all meaning flowed from being among "your own" (kinship) and those who might claim partial kinship (even as a guest) -- as opposed to those who were dangerously different, alien, and other -- and how we assigned varying status points to differentiation, all the way to where difference required bloody sanction.
Sanctioning difference became our sacred ritual: The very foundation of how we enshrined our own identity by killing the other. War itself became our ultimate ritual -- where togetherness could be made perfect and whole by collectively enshrining the ritual death of the other. Killing is our celebration of identity.
Homer caught this song and its irresistible chant in the Iliad. His poem is the oldest testament of celebratory killing. We call Homer's world The Heroic Age. We profess to love heroes, but ancient Greek ideal was very different from our cartoon banner of the Marvel Comic superhero. Theirs in contrast was sculpted into iron portraits of transcendent, sacred killers -- where the greatest was always, always Achilles.
Muslim warriors today unconsciously still strive to replicate the achievement of Achilles. They operate unashamedly in the reality-space of ancient concepts of kinship and the other, in which the hero serves as the instrument of shared identity celebrated and realized in battle. 
Yet Muslims have a bigger identity too -- also rooted in classical antiquity -- the Universalist vision of Islam itself. Moreover Muslim warriors embrace what they believe is a pure vision of Islam because it is authentically original, meaning, unsullied by all corruption since the moment of origination.
We must never forget that Islam was the very last act of classical antiquity, and that as the canonical child of Homer -- 1500 years downstream -- Islam too hearkens back to the passionate currents of the Iliad. Islam is thus the last great Greco-Roman story from antiquity. It is both the last take on the Iliad just as much as it is the last testament of the Christian and Jewish Bibles.
This is an apparent paradox until we understand two things.
First, as John Lendon tells us, Greco-Roman thought and belief was always in the end about the Iliad:
[The] congruence of Homeric and later Greek ethics ensured that the heroes were not only old, but also admirable, and so the past of the Greeks was not inert, but to be imitated by the men of the present. The heroes of epic always sat invisible upon the shoulders of the Greeks, whispering their counsel ... epic made the Greek past irreducibly past, and so rather than envisaging the past as the present, they tended rather to understand the present by means of the past.
Islam never fully escaped the iron vision and vise of Greco-Roman reality -- always looking back to be the heroes of origination. 1400 years after, Muslims still yearn to renew Islam as though they were riding with Muhammad and his band of brothers -- like Emperors Trajan or Julian desperately reaching for the brass ring of Achilles.
Moreover, we can say that what goes for classical antiquity not only goes for Islam, but that Islam in its deepest currents passionately follows its Greek fathers. Like it or not, Islam grew up within, and then grew out from, the greater heart of the Roman Empire in the 7th century -- and Islam's inner heart remained "Byzantine," in its deeper framing of narrative, virtue, and piety, until the fall of the Ottomans.
So we are dealing with the last living remnants of classical antiquity, still hearkening backwards to Homer's "Age of Heroes."
Latter-day Brothers of Muhammad (al Ansar) are literally -- and literarily -- living the dream -- as Alastair Crooke describes so eloquently. Yet their highly stylized behavior, quite unconsciously, hews to archaic Iliadic archtypes. These Achilles wannabes evoke five tropes central to the Iliad. Think of these as five anchors to life defining their heroic identity -- not consciously, but deeply.
- Heroic death. The warrior's death is central to all heroic societies, but why does one seek to die on the battlefield? Some heroic modes celebrate self-sacrifice for the community, like Beowulf. In Takfiri Islam it is martyrdom for God. But Achilles stands out by reminding us that the ultimate fulfillment in heroic society is killing -- and his abiding song of wrath spells this out how if there is joy in delivering death, there must also be joy in at last embracing it.
- Blood sacrifice (Dennis Hughes, Human Sacrifice in Ancient Greece). In one of the most chilling passages of Homer's heroic, Achilles slits the throats of twelve noble Trojan boys, to honor the burial pyre of Patroclus. Plato was so distressed at this passage that he simply denied Achilles' act. What if Homer created a dispensation for human sacrifice after battle through antiquity and its Muslim inheritors? Blood sacrifice of prisoners is hallowed in Muslim lore.
- Supplication (Gordon Kelley, Battlefield Supplication in the Iliad). The ritual death of James Foley has perhaps its most moving counterpart in the Iliad, in Achilles' killing of Lykaon. James Foley made only indirect supplication, but his "I wish I had more time to see my family" still fit heroic age poetic venues in which the plea of the person to be executed can be dismissed in the context of the greater wrong and rage that the killer must exorcize. Lykaon might so easily, like Foley, be spared, yet he is complicit in deeper ways:
So, friend, you die also. Why all this clamor about it?
 Patroklos also is dead, who was better by far than you are.
 Do you not see what a man I am, how huge, how splendid
 and born of a great father, and the mother who bore me immortal? 
Execution thus demonstrates how the enemy is all one, to be destroyed (no exceptions), but also that each ritual slaying enhances dominance (today, of Islam) over the apostates and unbelievers. Yet, like ancient Greeks, we are buying into the atavistic frames of heroic age society: Witness Shirley Sotloff.
- Compensation (Donna Wilson, Ransom and Revenge in Heroic Identity) Private monetary compensation for wrong and ransom is just as embedded in the Muslim world today as it was in the Heroic Age. The key dynamic in the Iliad is that Achilles rejects former norms of reciprocity -- indeed all forms of compensation -- after the death of Patroklos. The wrong is too great to be assuaged by money. We see this counterpointed in the $130 million ransom demanded for James Foley -- itself an enunciation of how the wrongs done Islam are too great for America ever to pay off. 
- Mourning and funerary rites (Robin Norris, Mourning Rites: Beowulf, the Iliad, and the War in Iraq). Elaborate funeral rites and extended lamentation mark the passing of the hero -- Patroklos, Beowulf, or the pious Muslim warrior today. Yet with remembrance, not all the dead of battle share the hero's fate. Essential to Achilles' killing of say, Lykaon, or Da'ish's ritual beheadings is a desire to tell us that such men did not die as heroes but as sacrificial animals:
After flinging Lykaon's body by the foot into the River Skamandros, Achilleus bids the fish to feed upon it. The image that Achilleus evokes -- of fish nibbling on the "shining fat" of the corpse -- also deny the possibility of funeral rites for Lykaon's body (Kelley). 
So the Islamic State would take from us the chance to mourn our own: Just as we have -- perhaps unwittingly -- stripped honorable grief from them. "In the world of the Iliad, funeral interruption is the ultimate insult to one's enemy." How about a Mk. 81 JDAM Predator "interruption"?
What do Muslim warriors of this new Heroic Age seek to achieve against us? Just this: Dominance. We, progeny of civilization, have no idea what that word really means. As reified a commentator as Robert Kaplan -- once-anointed of the Imperial Palace -- can only come up with this little nugget to imagine the enemy describing themselves: "We will triumph because we observe absolutely no constraints." 
How Kaplan showcases our foolish ways. When the Islamic state executes and takes a head, its message is really this: You are weak. You are no more than women. With your drones, you are worse than women. You will fall before us. You will beseech our mercy and then prostrate yourselves before the truth of God, before you die.
The wrath of the Islamic State, like Achilles, is fueled by the pain of loss -- a century of shame and degradation -- but just as fully by the social need to create rites that overturn this impossible iron vise. The humiliation of Arab Sunni Islam is today one of the most compelling dynamics of all human history. 
We are fools to be surprised by this, or by the brutal truth that so many have turned on us. Nor should it surprise us that the still living grand community of Islam has turned instinctively at last to rites of resistance and deliverance; nor that, forced to pursue of what such rites offer, that old rules, especially rules we imposed, are literally to be thrown away.
How did the magisterial world of Islam -- like the heavenly Alhambra, a last holdout in Western romance -- become lost? How have Achilles' "Heroic Age" rules come to demand payment now only through our own blood, shame, and humiliation?
The truth is that we created them. Stripping people of Modernity through prolonged tyranny will force them on passages to original constructs of identity -- even before civilization. These past decades the United States has unconsciously helped reposition Muslim Sunni Arab identity, both through our unthinking support of corrupt Saudi Takfiri missionary enterprises, but also through our brutalization -- both subtle and head slamming -- of their world. As we talked democracy we also simultaneously withheld it. We gave no way out save the way they have taken now.
Hence only blood can cleanse and purify Islam now: And for all Muslims -- more of them than you could ever imagine -- such cleansing must be our blood.
This is the bad news: This is what it means to face a consciousness from before civilization. Today we confront the consequences of a century of casual cruelty. So poetry and heroes we once cherished emerge as if from ancient prism, to kill us all.
I have one word: Do not fight them on their terms. They are our Achilles-Nemesis. They seek the arena of single combat, of mano-a-mano, of sacrifice and supplication. Do not let them dictate to us their passionate Homeric battlefield, for these reasons:
We will lose that battle, in the act of losing ourselves. 
We are civilization, which is a precious creation only ours to lose.
Let us not go into battle against Achilles then, as "Hector slayer of men" -- but rather as the true sons and daughters of Washington, Lincoln, and Roosevelt.

-=-=-TITLE: A Dose of Nuance: Triggers we can do without - Opinion - Jerusalem Post
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT:  It’s been many years since I completed my studies at New York City’s Columbia University, but I still occasionally read the student newspaper, The Spectator, to get a sense of what’s going on.
Columbia is a great place – it was then, and it is now (despite some faculty members’ reprehensible attitude to Israel) – and as I read The Spec, as we called it back then, I often grow wistful about the world I left when we moved to Israel almost two decades ago.
Recently, however, an article in The Spec reminded me not of what a great educational experience Columbia was (though it certainly was), but how much healthier Israeli society is (at least in some ways) than its American counterpart. The column “Our identities matter in core classrooms” was about the increasingly discussed issue of “trigger warnings” that students are demanding in college courses.
What’s a trigger warning? Here is the language of four Columbia students: “During the week spent on Ovid’s Metamorphoses, the class was instructed to read the myths of Persephone and Daphne, both of which include vivid depictions of rape and sexual assault. As a survivor of sexual assault, [a] student described being triggered while reading such detailed accounts of rape throughout the work. However, the student said her professor focused on the beauty of the language and the splendor of the imagery when lecturing on the text. As a result, the student completely disengaged.”
See the latest opinion pieces on our Opinion & Blogs Facebook page
So, what do the students want? They want to be warned. About scenes with sexual violence. About scenes with racist overtones. About scenes with misogynistic language. They want to be prepared emotionally for the trauma that reading great works of literature can entail.
The demand is becoming so widespread that The New York Times actually devoted space to an entire debate on the subject (“Restraint of expression on college campuses”) a year ago.
As I read the new column in The Spec, though, I was reminded of several moments at Shalem College, here in Jerusalem, where the intellectual atmosphere is entirely different. And healthier. I remembered, for example, a moment in October 2013, when I sat in on a class in which our students were reading The Iliad. They came to a war scene in one of the last of The Iliad’s 24 books, and one student remarked, “The Greek reader had to know that Homer’s description of war here isn’t realistic. This is an airbrushed description of war; this isn’t what war is like.”
Suddenly, it was silent in the room.
Twenty-five students, sitting with an ancient Greek text translated into Hebrew, sat immobile. I looked at their faces, especially the faces of the men. That seemingly innocent comment about Homer’s description of war not being realistic had taken them to a very different place. They had been transported – to a different setting, far from books, far from the calm and security of a college classroom, far from the rarefied world of Homeric texts.
The professor, a fabulous teacher, knew better than to say anything. He allowed the silence to persist – like a mist that needed time to clear – and then, in a soft tone, said nothing about the comment and simply continued the discussion.
I listened carefully to what followed.
There were people there, I knew, who had been traumatized by what they’d experienced in the army. (A few months later, one of those students actually received a medal for extraordinary bravery.) There were people who had lost friends.
Yet there was no sense that these students wanted to be protected from the texts. Their experiences had made them stronger, not more fragile. Their past, painful as it had been, did not lead them to shy away from reading Homer – rather, it enriched their reading of The Iliad.
From what they had lived through, they learned that their lives – their hopes, the things they dread, their dreams and nightmares – made them part of a conversation that has been unfolding for thousands of years.
They understand that the reason we read Homer, and Bible, and Talmud, and modern literature, at Shalem College is to weave their pasts – the pleasant as well as the challenging – into the tapestry of what great and majestic cultures have been saying about these issues for centuries.
We shared with our students at Shalem this newfound American demand for “trigger warnings,” and they were simply perplexed. What’s the point of learning, they asked, if we’re going to shy away from the issues that are most critical? Why read these texts if, precisely when they evoke powerful emotions, we’re going to hunker down in fear? It was the reaction I’d expected – and the reaction I’d hoped they’d have.
This is a country in which it is easy to worry about the kids we’re producing.
Too many of them are too boisterous, too many of them don’t know how to stand in line, how to board a plane politely, how to listen to those with whom they disagree and respect those whose life-choices are different from their own. All true. But there is a slice of Israeli society, it behooves us to recall, that has internalized the stressful and often frightening reality of Israeli life in order to become deeper, more thoughtful, more nuanced and more open.
The world we cherish will not be preserved by running from conflict or shielding ourselves from the uncomfortable.
There is evil in the world, and too often, the West is unprepared to call that evil what it is. There are forces that wish to destroy everything we stand for, and too often, the West is unprepared to stand up to them, to draw lines in the sand, to make it clear we believe in certain values, in particular principles, and we’ll sacrifice for them.
We live in a world bereft of Churchills and Roosevelts. Yet we also live in a country that has produced an extraordinary young generation. We cannot yet know precisely how, but there’s every reason to believe that when people look back on what saved Israel in the early part of the 21st century, it will have been in large measure a generation of young people not afraid to face their fears, a generation willing to face their pasts.
It will likely have been due to a generation of Israelis who understand that it is only when we are disturbed, shaken and unsettled that we are poised to do truly great things.
The writer is senior vice president, Koret Distinguished Fellow and chair of the core curriculum at Jerusalem’s Shalem College, Israel’s first liberal arts college. His latest book is Menachem Begin: The Battle for Israel’s Soul; he is now writing a concise history of the State of Israel.

-=-=-TEXT: Mobile operators plan to block online advertising Robert Cookson, Digital Media Correspondent ©Getty 
Several mobile operators plan to block advertising on their networks, setting the stage for a battle with digital media companies such as Google , AOL and Yahoo . 
One European wireless carrier told the Financial Times that it has installed blocking software in its data centres and planned to turn it on before the end of 2015. More Qatar’s ambitions struggle on US screens 
The software prevents most types of advertising from loading in web pages and apps, though it does not interfere with “in-feed” ads of the kind used by Facebook and Twitter. 
The blocking technology was developed by Shine, an Israeli start-up whose shareholders include Horizon Ventures, the investment fund of Li Ka-shing, Asia’s richest person. 
Mr Li also controls Hutchison Whampoa, one of the world’s largest telecoms groups. 
“Tens of millions of mobile subscribers around the world will be opting in to ad blocking by the end of the year,” said Roi Carthy, chief marketing officer of Shine. “If this scales, it could have a devastating impact on the online advertising industry.” 
Verizon, the largest US telecoms group, this week paid $4.4bn to buy AOL , seeking to gain a foothold in the rapidly growing market for advertising on mobile devices . 
Marketers will spend almost $69bn this year on mobile ads — more than triple the sum they spent two years ago — according to research group eMarketer. 
Shine said it was working with a number of operators, including one with almost 40m subscribers, though it declined to name them. 
An executive at a European carrier confirmed that it and several of its peers are planning to start blocking adverts this year. 
The executive said that the carrier will initially launch an advertising-free service for customers on an opt-in basis. 
But it is also considering a more radical idea that it calls “the bomb”, which would apply across its entire network of millions of subscribers at once. The idea is to specifically target Google, blocking advertising on its websites in an attempt to force the company into giving up a cut of its revenues. 
The Silicon Valley company is the world’s largest advertising business, generating $60bn a year from search, YouTube, and services such as Google Display Network and DoubleClick, which both deliver ads for third-party sites. 
The executive at the mobile operator considering “the bomb” acknowledged that targeting Google could be risky from both a legal and public relations perspective. Under “net neutrality” rules in the European Union and the US, telecoms companies are forced to treat all data that flow through their networks equally. 
But even within those markets, it would be feasible to block adverts on Google “just for an hour or a day” to bring the company to the negotiating table, the executive said. 
Many mobile operators are frustrated that digital media companies profit from their high-speed networks without having to invest in the infrastructure behind them. Such irritation was inflamed last month when Google launched Project Fi , its own wireless carrier in the US. 
What are ad-blockers? Software that prevents advertisements from loading in web pages or apps. Blockers use a predetermined blacklist to determine what type of ads are blocked and on what sites. They also adjust a page’s layout so that it looks normal after the ads have been removed. 
Why do people block ads? Common motivations are to eliminate intrusive advertising such as pop-ups and to improve the appearance of web pages by removing clutter. For users of mobile devices, loading a web page is also faster when the adverts have been removed. Blockers also reduce the risk of a computer being hijacked by malware that is sometimes distributed through ad networks. Lastly, blockers can protect privacy by preventing websites from collecting user data. 
What are the downsides? One irritation for users is that ad blockers sometimes block too much content and interfere with the normal loading of a web page. Blockers also consume computer resources.

-=-=-TITLE:  <b>Iliad</b> - Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
-=-=-SNIPPET:  The Iliad is the oldest surviving work of Greek literature. Originally an oral epic npoem, meaning it used to be said, not read, it was written down in the 8th centurynxa0...
-=-=-TEXT: The Iliad (Gr: Iliás) is an epic poem by the ancient Greek poet Homer, which recounts some of the significant events of the final weeks of the Trojan War and the Greek siege of the city of Troy (which was also known as Ilion, Ilios or Ilium in ancient times). Written in the mid-8th Century BCE, The Iliad is usually considered to be the earliest work in the whole Western literary tradition, and one of the best known and loved stories of all time. Through its portayal of the epic subject matter of the Trojan War, the stirring scenes of bloody battle, the wrath of Achilles and the constant interventions of the gods, it explores themes of glory, wrath, homecoming and fate, and has provided subjects and stories for many other later Greek, Roman and Renaissance writings.
The story covered by The Iliad begins nearly ten years into the seige of Troy by the Greek forces, led by Agamemnon, King of Mycenae. The Greeks are quarrelling about whether or not to return Chryseis, a Trojan captive of King Agamemnon, to her father, Chryses, a priest of Apollo. When Agamemnon refuses and threatens to ransom the girl to her father, the offended Apollo plagues them with a pestilence.
The Greeks, at the behest of the warrior-hero Achilles, force Agamemnon to return Chryseis in order to appease Apollo and end the pestilence. But, when Agamemnon eventually reluctantly agrees to give her back, he takes in her stead Briseis, Achilless own war-prize concubine. Feeling dishonoured, Achilles wrathfully withdraws both himself and his Myrmidon warriors from the Trojan War.
Testing the resolve of the Greeks, Agamemnon feigns a homeward order, but Odysseus encourages the Greeks to pursue the fight. During a brief truce in the hostilities, Paris and Menelaus meet in single combat over Helen, while she and old King Priam of Troy watch from the city walls and, despite the goddess Aphrodites intervention on behalf of the over-matched Paris, Menelaus is the victor. The goddess Athena, however, who favours the Greeks, soon provokes a Trojan truce-breaking and battle begins anew.
The Greek hero Diomedes, strengthened by Athena, drives the Trojans before him but, in his arrogance and blood-lust, strikes and injures Aphrodite. Despite the misgivings of his wife, Andromache, the Trojan hero, Hector, son of King Priam, challenges the Greek warrior-hero Ajax to single combat, and is almost overcome in battle. Throughout all, in the background, the various gods and goddesses (particularly Hera, Athena, Apollo and Poseidon) continue to argue among themselves and to manipulate and intervene in the struggle, despite Zeus specific orders to the contrary.
Achilles steadfastly refuses to give in to pleas for help from Agamemnon, Odysseus, Ajax, Phoenix and Nestor, spurning the offered honours and riches and even Agamemnons belated offer to return Briseis to him. Diomedes and Odysseus sneak into the Trojan camp and wreak havoc. But, with Achilles and his warriors out of battle, the tide appears to begin to turn in favour of the Trojans. Agamemnon is wounded in the battle and, despite the heroics of Ajax, Hector successfully breaches the fortified Greek camp, wounding Odysseus and Diomedes in the process, and threatens to set the Greek ships on fire.
Torn between his allegiances, Achilles orders his friend and lover, Patroclus, to dress in Achilles own armour and to lead the Myrmidons in repelling the Trojans. Intoxicated by his success, Patroclus forgets Achilles warning, and pursues the fleeing Trojans to the walls of Troy and would have taken the city  were it not for the actions of Apollo. In the heat of the battle, though, Hector finds the disguised Patroclus and, thinking him to be Achilles, fights and (again with Apollos help) kills him. Menelaus and the Greeks manage to recover Patrocluss corpse before Hector can inflict more damage.
Distraught at the death of his companion, Achilles then reconciles with Agamemnon and rejoins the fray, despite knowing his deadly fate, and drives all the Trojans before him in his fury. As the ten year war reaches its climax, even the gods join in the battle and the earth shakes with the clamour of the combat.
Clad in new armour fashioned specially for him by Hephaestus, Achilles takes revenge for his friend Patroclus by slaying Hector in single combat, but then defiles and desecrates his corpse for several days. Now, at last, Patroclus funeral can be celebrated in what Achilles sees as a fitting manner. Hectors father, King Priam, emboldened by his grief and aided by Hermes, recovers Hectors corpse from Achilles, and The Iliad ends with Hectors funeral during a twelve day truce granted by Achilles.
Although attributed to Homer, "The Iliad" is clearly dependent on an older oral tradition and may well have been the collective inheritance of many singer-poets over a long period of time (the historical Fall of Troy is usually dated to around the start of the 12th Century BCE). Homer was probably one of the first generation of authors who were also literate, as the Greek alphabet was introduced in the early 8th Century BCE, and the language used in his epic poems is an archaic version of Ionic Greek, with admixtures from certain other dialects such as Aeolic Greek. However, it is by no means certain that Homer himself (if in fact such a man ever really existed) actually wrote down the verses.
The Iliad was part of a group of ancient poems known as the "Epic Cycle", most of which are now lost to us, which dealt with the history of the Trojan War and the events surrounding it. Whether or not they were written down, we do know that Homer's poems (along with others in the Epic Cycle) were recited in later days at festivals and ceremonial occasions by professional singers called "rhapsodes", who beat out the measure with rhythm staffs.
The Iliad itself does not cover the early events of the Trojan War, which had been launched ten years before the events described in the poem in order to rescue Helen, the wife of  King Menelaus of Sparta, after her abduction by the Trojan prince, Paris. Likewise, the death of Achilles and the eventual fall of Troy are not covered in the poem, and these matters are the subjects of other (non-Homeric) "Epic Cycle" poems, which survive only in fragments. The Odyssey, a separate work also by Homer, narrates Odysseus decade-long journey home to Ithaca after the end of the Trojan War.
The poem consists of twenty-four scrolls, containing 15,693 lines of dactylic hexameter verse. The entire poem has a formal rhythm that is consistent throughout (making it easier to memorize) and yet varied slightly from line to line (preventing it from being monotonous). Many phrases, sometimes whole passages, are repeated verbatim over and over again throughout The Iliad, partly to fulfill the demands of the metre and partly as part of the formulaic oral tradition. In the same way, many of the descriptive phrases that are linked with a certain character (such as "swift-footed Achilles", "Diomedes of the great war cry", "Hector of the shining helm", and "Agamemnon the lord of men") match the number of syllables in a hero's name, and are repeated regularly to the extent that they almost seem to become part of the characters' names themselves.
The immortal gods and goddesses are portrayed as characters in The Iliad, displaying individuality and will in their actions, but they are also stock religious figures, sometimes allegorical, sometimes psychological, and their relation to humans is extremely complex. They are often used as a way of explaining how or why an event took place, but they are also sometimes used as comic relief from the war, mimicking, parodying and mocking mortals. Indeed, it is often the gods, not the mortals, who seem casual, petty and small-minded.
The main theme of the poem is that of war and peace, and the whole poem is essentially a description of war and fighting. There is a sense of horror and futility built into Homer's chronicle, and yet, posed against the viciousness, there is a sense of heroism and glory that adds a glamour to the fighting: Homer appears both to abhor war and to glorify it. Frequent similes tell of the peacetime efforts back home in Greece, and serve as contrasts to the war, reminding us of the human values that are destroyed by fighting, as well as what is worth fighting for.
The concept of heroism, and the honour that results from it, is also one of the major currents running through the poem. Achilles in particular represents the heroic code and his struggle revolves around his belief in an honour system, as opposed to Agamemnon's reliance on royal privilege. But, as fighter after heroic fighter enters the fray in search of honour and is slain before our eyes, the question always remains as to whether their struggle, heroic or not, is really worth the sacrifice.
Menin or menis (anger or wrath) is the word that opens The Iliad, and one of the major themes of the poem is Achilles coming to terms with his anger and taking responsibility for his actions and emotions.

-=-=-TEXT: DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Research and Markets ( http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/kdq6bp/simonly ) has announced the addition of the "SIM-only Propositions Positioning & Impact" report to their offering.
In recent years there has been a surge in sales of SIM-only propositions. Well-designed SIM-only propositions can help operators achieve cost reductions as a result of lower handset subsidies and lower sales commissions. However, lack of contract commitment means the customer can leave at relatively short notice, with higher churn a consequence. Additionally, lack of control of the devices connected can potentially lead to revenue loss, as customers equipped with old handsets may not be able to make the most of new digital services.
In this report we look at the SIM-only propositions currently marketed by leading European MNOs and MVNOs across three key European markets. The analysis includes a review of tariff design, product differentiation and positioning, in the context of entry-level postpay subscriptions, converged multi-play propositions and data-only SIMs.
The report concludes with a set of recommendations for MNOs aimed at optimising SIM-only policies, with the ultimate objective of offering customers plenty of choice whilst maintaining a healthy position in terms of both customer mix and key performance indicators.
Key Topics Covered:
1 Overview
2 Introduction
3 Significance of SIM-only Policies
3.1 Reasons for Operators to Offer SIM-only Plans
3.2 Market Drivers for SIM-only Sales
3.3 Changes in Handset Sourcing and Streamlining of Channel

-=-=-TEXT: Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press circa 1439 A.D., and Homer's The Iliad was likely written around 762 B.C. Here's what Jennifer Lopez's new movie The Boy Next Door says a first edition of The Iliad looks like:
The movie tells the story of Claire (Jennifer Lopez), a broken-hearted CLASSICS TEACHER, who begins a dangerous sexual relationship with Noah, her new 19-year-old next door neighbor. Before things get really racy (and racy they certainly get), Noah, a fellow CLASSICS ENTHUSIAST, has to woo her—which he does by picking up this "first edition" of a nearly 3,000-year-old book for "a buck at a garage sale." 
Who knew that old Greek scrolls came so cheap and beautifully bound? I haven't felt this informed since J. Lo taught me about Turkey Time.

-=-=-TEXT: The Iliad [1] is the oldest surviving work of Greek literature. Originally an oral epic poem, meaning it used to be said, not read, it was written down in the 8th century BC. It is an epic or very long poem made up of 24 chapters written in hexameters. It is probably based on a real event, the attack on Troy by the Mycenaeans. The poem includes early Greek myths and legends. The traditional writer of the Iliad is Homer. However, scholars are not sure if the poem was really written by one person.
The story takes place in the Trojan War. It talks about the confrontations of the warrior Achilles and King Agamemnon. The story itself covers only a few weeks at the end of the war, but it also talks about many of the Greek myths about the war. It tells the story from the wrath of Achilles, to the death and funeral of Hector and the siege of Troy.
Together with its sequel, the Odyssey, it is one of the two major Greek epic poems. Traditionally, both are attributed to Homer.
Some important characters in the Iliad are Achilles, Odysseus, Agamemnon, Menelaus, Priam, Hector, Paris, and Helen.
The poem starts with the god Apollo having sent a plague to the Greeks, because they captured the daughter of one of his priests. Agamemnon is forced to give her back, but also takes away Briseis from her owner Achilles. Achilles is angry and refuses to fight. But when his friend Patroclus is killed by Hector, he starts to fight again and kills Hector in a duel. Later Hector's father Priam comes in secret to Achilles to take back his favorite son's body to give it a proper funeral, which Achilles allows him to do. The poem ends with the funeral of Hector.

-=-=-TITLE: Mobile operators plan to block ads
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: Mobile operators plan to block online advertising Robert Cookson, Digital Media Correspondent ©Getty 
Several mobile operators plan to block advertising on their networks, setting the stage for a battle with digital media companies such as Google , AOL and Yahoo . 
One European wireless carrier told the Financial Times that it has installed blocking software in its data centres and planned to turn it on before the end of 2015. More Qatar’s ambitions struggle on US screens 
The software prevents most types of advertising from loading in web pages and apps, though it does not interfere with “in-feed” ads of the kind used by Facebook and Twitter. 
The blocking technology was developed by Shine, an Israeli start-up whose shareholders include Horizon Ventures, the investment fund of Li Ka-shing, Asia’s richest person. 
Mr Li also controls Hutchison Whampoa, one of the world’s largest telecoms groups. 
“Tens of millions of mobile subscribers around the world will be opting in to ad blocking by the end of the year,” said Roi Carthy, chief marketing officer of Shine. “If this scales, it could have a devastating impact on the online advertising industry.” 
Verizon, the largest US telecoms group, this week paid $4.4bn to buy AOL , seeking to gain a foothold in the rapidly growing market for advertising on mobile devices . 
Marketers will spend almost $69bn this year on mobile ads — more than triple the sum they spent two years ago — according to research group eMarketer. 
Shine said it was working with a number of operators, including one with almost 40m subscribers, though it declined to name them. 
An executive at a European carrier confirmed that it and several of its peers are planning to start blocking adverts this year. 
The executive said that the carrier will initially launch an advertising-free service for customers on an opt-in basis. 
But it is also considering a more radical idea that it calls “the bomb”, which would apply across its entire network of millions of subscribers at once. The idea is to specifically target Google, blocking advertising on its websites in an attempt to force the company into giving up a cut of its revenues. 
The Silicon Valley company is the world’s largest advertising business, generating $60bn a year from search, YouTube, and services such as Google Display Network and DoubleClick, which both deliver ads for third-party sites. 
The executive at the mobile operator considering “the bomb” acknowledged that targeting Google could be risky from both a legal and public relations perspective. Under “net neutrality” rules in the European Union and the US, telecoms companies are forced to treat all data that flow through their networks equally. 
But even within those markets, it would be feasible to block adverts on Google “just for an hour or a day” to bring the company to the negotiating table, the executive said. 
Many mobile operators are frustrated that digital media companies profit from their high-speed networks without having to invest in the infrastructure behind them. Such irritation was inflamed last month when Google launched Project Fi , its own wireless carrier in the US. 
What are ad-blockers? Software that prevents advertisements from loading in web pages or apps. Blockers use a predetermined blacklist to determine what type of ads are blocked and on what sites. They also adjust a page’s layout so that it looks normal after the ads have been removed. 
Why do people block ads? Common motivations are to eliminate intrusive advertising such as pop-ups and to improve the appearance of web pages by removing clutter. For users of mobile devices, loading a web page is also faster when the adverts have been removed. Blockers also reduce the risk of a computer being hijacked by malware that is sometimes distributed through ad networks. Lastly, blockers can protect privacy by preventing websites from collecting user data. 
What are the downsides? One irritation for users is that ad blockers sometimes block too much content and interfere with the normal loading of a web page. Blockers also consume computer resources. For online publishers, ad blockers are an existential threat. Given that most free services rely on advertising, the spread of blocking threatens to upend the economics of the internet. 
Google said it would be unreasonable for mobile operators to block ads, arguing that: “People pay for mobile internet packages so they can access the apps, video streaming, webmail and other services they love, many of which are funded by ads. Google and other web companies invest heavily in developing these services — and in the behind-the-scenes infrastructure to deliver them.” 
Blocking advertising on mobile networks is likely to provoke a fierce backlash from digital media companies. In 2013, Free, the French internet service provider owned by Iliad , blocked ads by default through its Freebox modem, causing huge controversy. It was forced to scrap the initiative within a week under pressure from the Socialist government. 
Mr Carthy of Shine said that eliminating intrusive adverts is a “consumer right”, even if it undermines the business model of online publishers that rely on advertising. 
“Online advertising is out of control and it’s polluting the user experience,” he said. Pop-ups, auto-playing videos and other forms of digital advertising can consume between 10 and 50 per cent of a mobile subscriber’s data plan, he added. 
While ad-blocking is a new phenomenon on mobiles, it is more established on PCs and growing quickly. More than 140m people, or 5 per cent of the online population, use software such as Adblock Plus to eliminate adverts when browsing the web on laptops or desktop computers. 
As the Financial Times reported in February, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have paid the makers of Adblock Plus to allow some ads on their sites to slip through its filters. 
Google’s relationship with ad-blocking is further complicated by the fact that such software is the most popular type of free add-on to Chrome, its popular web browser. Related Topics

-=-=-TITLE: Book review: Seiobo There Below | The National
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: The Review 
Born in Hungary in 1954, László Krasznahorkai is one of contemporary fiction’s most serious and challenging writers. Susan Sontag, famously, called him “the contemporary master of the apocalypse”, which is accurate, especially if your idea of the end of the world includes complex punctuation and sentences far longer than this book review. 
Krasznahorkai is a finalist for the Man Booker International Prize this year, the winner to be announced on Tuesday. This month also features the UK publication of the English translation of Krasznahorkai’s acclaimed 2008 novel, Seiobo There Below . 
Seiobo There Below is the first novel that I have read by Krasznahorkai that doesn’t feel like its events take place in black-and-white – or in hell. Satantago , his revered 1985 novel about an infernal, decaying, rain-beleaguered community losing its collective mind, was so bleak that, putting the book aside, it made even the most mundane things in life seem joyous and colourful. The Sun still existed. The trees had pretty green leaves. Reading it was an experience both exhilarating – those mad, unfurling sentences – and relentlessly depressing. 
Seiobo There Below is something altogether different. There is beauty in this novel. In fact, an investigation into the nature of beauty, art and the divine are Seiobo There Below ’s primary concerns. 
This, however, does not mean that it is an easy read. In fact, it may be Krasznahorkai’s most challenging book – which means that it may be one of the most challenging books published in recent memory. Casual readers beware. 
Firstly, those sentences. For the most part, the sentences in Seiobo There Below go on for pages, sometimes entire chapters, words caught in a huge net of commas and semi-colons and dashes. On top of that, most of these sentences consist of independent stories, or vignettes. You’re not allowed a moment’s respite. It can be infuriating. For the effect to work, one has to enter a patient, almost meditative state, and let Krasznahorkai’s sentences pull you along, twist around the subject, illuminate this or that crevice, constantly moving, like light on water. 
This can either sweep you in, or you send your attention spiralling out into the margins. Both happened to me while reading. There were times where I’d lose my place, my patience, literally lose the plot, and I would back up, try to catch hold again, fail, and finally have to put the book down for a break. Then there were the sentences that were mesmerising, had an almost psychedelic effect, and it was as if time bent along with the words on the page until both completely disappeared. 
But what is Seiobo There Below about? Well, endless sentences aside, herein lies the novel’s primary difficulty. There is no single story or conventional plot in Krasznahorkai’s novel. It is a 450-page book that jumps between time, characters, lands and even languages. The creation of art, music and theatre feature heavily, as does the exploration of the artistic ritual as a conduit to or for the divine. What is the role of true beauty in our lives, and is it good or bad, seem to be what is being explored. 
That being said, the second chapter opens up with an untranslated Italian crossword puzzle. Why? I have absolutely no idea. The novel did not come with a Google Translate app and my Italian is non-existent. 
The names of characters and places pile up in a way I at first took to be gently humorous, like a parody of the Bible or The Iliad . The Japanese goddess Seiobo appears once to my knowledge. There is a museum guard enthralled by the Venus de Milo , a doomed tourist visiting the Acropolis, the cities of Venice and Kyoto, a Buddhist monastery, Russian icons, and things happening in biblical times, Renaissance Italy and contemporary Barcelona. It’s an encyclopaedic puzzle of a book, like a David Mitchell novel for the Mensa set. Thematically and philosophically things seem to link or complement each other, like the novelistic equivalent of a musical movement, a variation on a theme. But characters and stories do not link. My favourite chapter had an increasingly agitated man lecturing to peasants about how awful music has become since Bach. 
Should the novel come with a glossary? Should it be essential to look up something on Wikipedia every second page? There is a certain kind of reader who finds pleasure in this sort of challenge and the debatable depth provided by so much erudite information. I do not think that I am this kind of reader. 
One can imagine a full semester university course being taught on this daunting, strange novel. One can also imagine László Krasznahorkai deservedly winning the International Booker next week. Seiobo There Below is an extraordinary book that avoids the apocalypse but demands diligent reading and patience – and a knack for Italian crossword puzzles wouldn’t hurt either.

       Guide to Reading the Iliad   
The Iliad is an epic poem, composed around 800-725 B.C. and written   down sometime between 725 and 675 B.C. The ancient Greek word epos,   from which our word "epic" comes, means "word, utterance, poetic utterance,"   and the Iliad is precisely that. While we tend to think of a poem   as a short composition in verse about personal feelings, an epic is quite   different. Epic poetry is narrative, usually telling the story of a great   culture hero and his exploits. (The Iliad tells the story of Achilles,   and how his anger affected the fighting in the great war of Troy.) There   are two types of epics, literary and folk. Folk epics are composed anonymously   or traditionally, and attributed to shadowy ancient authors (like Homer),   while literary epics are written by one person (like Virgil). Folk epics   originate in oral cultures (those without writing), while literary epics   come from literate cultures.

Oral composition   
Both the Iliad and the Odyssey originated in the oral   tradition, in which a poet or singer, accompanying himself on the lyre   or harp, sings traditional tales of heroes. While the essential plot elements   of a traditional story cannot be altered, a gifted poet can shape the material   in complicated and interesting ways. For example, in the Iliad,   Homer centers his tale around the consequences of the quarrel between Agamemnon   and Achilles. The poet chooses not to tell other well-known episodes of   the war at Troy (for example, how the war started and how it ended) because   he wishes to concentrate on the issues of death, anger, and honor raised   by the quarrel. In fact, the Iliad and the Odyssey exhibit   such complexity and ingenuity of structure and theme that I believe they   were both put together out of traditional materials by a single poet.   
Rather than memorizing the whole song, the oral poet composes it as   he sings, stitching the poem together from a vast repertoire of memorized   phrases (called formulas) which fit the meter (called dactylic   hexameter) of the song. The Greek verb for such a singing-performance   is rhapsoideo, "I rhapsodize, stitch song together." Thus, the oral   poet needs to remember two things: 1) the essential story, and 2) many   formulas (examples: "strong-greaved Achaeans" or "long-haired Achaeans").   Originally for this kind of poetry, "Singing, performing, composing are   all facets of the same act" (Lord 13). (Bernard Knox gives some more examples   of formulas and discusses scenarios for how oral poetry gets written down   on pp. 15-22 of the introduction to the Iliad.) As he sings, the   poet is guided by his years of practice and by his knowledge of the story.   A story-line, heroic type-figures, the song, the meter, and the formulas   all help to keep the material memorable.   
Because these poems were composed orally, they exhibit unique characteristics.   You should be alert to these features as you read. With so many formulas,   some parts of the poem will repeat. For an oral poet, however, such repetition   is not a fault, but a vital technique (Lord 367). Repetition is a psychological   necessity in oral discourse, which vanishes as soon as it is uttered: "the   mind must move ahead more slowly, keeping close to the focus of attention   much of what has already been dealt with. Redundancy . . . keeps both speaker   and hearer surely on the track" (Ong 39-40). Sometimes a whole series of   lines will repeat, not because the poet is bored or uninventive, but because   oral poets often describe similar situations in the same formulaic manner.   Also, the poet could cruise through these repetitive passages while thinking   of what was coming up next in the poem.   
Repetition is not only a psychological necessity, it also keeps the   meter and the memory flowing smoothly. For example, formulas will often   repeat for metrical reasons: "Odysseus is polymetis (clever) not   just because he is this kind of character but also because without the   epithet polymetis he could not be readily worked into the meter"   (Ong 58-59). The word polymetis (also translated as "versatile"   or "resourceful") is a special kind of formula called an epithet,   an adjective or adjectival phrase which describes, in appropriate metrical   form, characteristics of gods or heroes. Examples: "versatile Odysseus"   or "Zeus the cloud gatherer." Often, an epithet will substitute for a character's   name, as when, for example, Agamemnon is called "son of Atreus" or "Atrides."   (The Greek suffix "-ides" means "son of.") The translator of our edition   of the Iliad, Stanley Lombardo, tries to a) limit the number of   epithets, and b) vary their wording, so you may not notice these epithets   in his translation as much as you might in others.   
Since an oral society possessed no written archives, lists, or books   and had no libraries, computers, or videotape on which to store information,   important cultural or historical knowledge was encoded into the more easily   remembered form of a story. The Iliad contains a long catalogue   or list of men and ships (115-127). Notice how this catalogue is narrated   as a series of actions, which are more memorable than a mere list would   be. And since the oral poem was the repository of the entire cultural memory   of a people, it also contains digressions, or breaks in the main   story-line which describe the history of various props (such as a scepter   or a weapon) or which relate the ancestry of a warrior in what might seem   to us to be over-elaborate detail. However, these details were prized by   the original audience, some of whom might trace their ancestry back to   characters in the story. Digressions also gave the audience the sense of   a full and living cultural background to the story.   
Because poets' powers of memory were considered godlike, the ancients   spoke of their songs as being inspired by nine goddesses called the Muses.   The Muses were the daughters of Mnemosyne ("memory") and Zeus. By claiming   that the Muses inspire their songs and know everything ("you are everywhere,   you know all things--") while poets know nothing ("all we hear is the distant   ring of glory, we know nothing" [Iliad 2.575-576]), poets authenticated   their individual utterance as the communal wisdom of gods and men. One   scholar goes so far as to say that the "formulas are the . . . words spoken   by the Muses themselves: they are recordings of the Muses who were always   present when anything happened" (Nagy 272).   
Two other techniques of oral poetry are designed to make the poem immediate   and exciting for listeners. Having no wide screens, special effects, or   dolby soundtracks, the ancient poets relied on "winged words" to keep their   stories vivid. For example, epic similes, or extended comparisons,   help the audience visualize and feel scenes, actions, and emotions. These   similes are usually precise and quite moving. Oral poets also performed   the speeches of the characters as a modern-day actors might. Such   emotional inflections and tones of voice are difficult to create on the   printed page; we will try to re-create the oral moment by listening to   sections of a tape of the Iliad in class. When recited, oral poem   are events, performances, and reaction to oral poems is communal and physical   rather than solitary and silent. Since they are close to the lifeworld   and not neutral signs on a white page, oral poems stress verbal and physical   struggle over reflective thought and exterior action over interior psychology.   The other side of verbal name-calling is the "fulsome expression of praise"   (Ong 45). Thus, the speeches of characters in the Iliad are often   either boastful or disdainful, full of extravagant praise or blame.   
Though literate cultures often look down upon those who cannot read   or write, Walter Ong reminds us that oral expression "can be quite sophisticated   and in its own way reflective. Navaho [storytellers] can provide elaborate   explanations of the various implications of the stories . . . and are perfectly   aware of such things as physical inconsistencies (for example, coyotes   with amber balls for eyes) and the need to interpret elements in the stories   symbolically. To assume that oral peoples are essentially unintelligent,   that their mental processes are 'crude', is the kind of thinking that for   centuries brought scholars to assume falsely that because the Homeric poems   are so skillful, they must be basically written compositions" (57).   
Nor should we assume, Ong continues, that oral thought is somehow "prelogical"   or "illogical" in any simplistic sense. Oral folk "understand very well   that if you push hard on a mobile object, the push causes it to move. What   is true is that they cannot organize elaborate concatenations of causes   in the analytic kind of linear sequences that can only be set up with the   help of texts. The lengthy sequences they produce, such as genealogies,   are not analytic but aggregative. But oral cultures can produce amazingly   complex and intelligent and beautiful organizations of thought and experience"   (57).   
Words are thought to have an almost magical power in oral cultures because   they are events, not signs. Ong writes: "Without writing, words as such   have no visual presence, even when the objects they represent are visual.   They are sounds. You might 'call' them back--'recall' them. But there is   no where to 'look' for them. . . . They are occurrences, events" (31).   The Hebrew term dabar means both "word" and "event." In contrast,   written words on the page are inert, just objects. Ong notes that the standard   Homeric epithet "winged words" conveys a sense of "evanescence, power,   and freedom" (77).

        The Heroic World   
The Iliad narrates the consequences of the anger or rage of Achilles.   The Greek word menin ("wrath" or "rage") is the first word in the   epic. Because of his anger, Achilles withdraws from the war and causes   his comrades the Achaeans to suffer "countless losses" (1.2) or deaths.   Death is central to the poem. Seth Schein writes:    
The overwhelming fact of life for the heroes of the Iliad is   their mortality, which stands in contrast to the immortality of the gods.   We see the central hero of the poem, Achilles, move toward disillusionment   and death to reach a new clarity about human existence in the wider context   of the eventual destruction of Troy and in an environment consisting almost   entirely of war and death. This environment offers scope for various kinds   and degrees of heroic achievement, but only at the cost of self-destruction   and the destruction of others, who live in the same environment and share   the same values. (1-2)   As we will see when Odysseus visits the underworld in the Odyssey,   the afterlife in Homer is a dull, shadowy, listless affair, in which empty   and witless souls wander, shells of their former selves. Therefore, it   is important that the hero achieve some meaning on earth by the way he   conducts his life and achieves his inevitable death. Life becomes meaningful   and valuable for the hero because he can win honor (in Greek, timé)--the   "public esteem" (Dodds 17) of his fellow-warriors in this life and glory   (in Greek, kleos)--the "reputation" (Schein 71) which poets will   sing of after his death.     
In book 12 of the Iliad, the Lycian hero Sarpedon begins a pep-talk   to his friend Glaucus with a rhetorical question:   
   Notice that the visible marks of honor are gifts, expressed here as the   best cuts of meat. The Greek word for honor, timé, can also   mean "price" or "value" (Schein 71). Those who are the best fighters should   receive the largest share or portion of the spoils of war. The more gifts,   the more stuff a hero accumulates, the more honor he has. Somewhat paradoxically,   one can also gain honor by being big and liberal and noble enough to give   gifts to others. Notice also that Sarpedon implies that ordinary fighting   men honor their leaders at least in part because these leaders protect   them. When Achilles withdraws from the war, he allows his own personal   sense of injured honor to outweigh his duty to protect the rest of his   less-gifted, less-honored comrades. In contrast to honor, glory   occurs mostly after death, when poets can sing of a hero's immortal deeds.   In the world of the Iliad, the honors and gifts showered upon a   hero come to an end with death, but his glory lives on forever in the stories   that poets sing. By achieving imperishable glory, a hero ensures that his   name and fame will live on after he has gone on to the rather meaningless   afterlife in the underworld.   
The opposite of glory (kleos) is shame or disgrace (aischros).   Glorious actions were praised, while shameful actions were blamed. A shameful   act was not necessarily considered immoral or wrong, but "ugly" (the other   meaning of aischros). [In this sense, the opposite of shame (aischros)   is not glory (kleos), but "beauty" (kalos).] The heroes'   code of honor stressed achievement of an exterior amoral ideal rather than   an interior moral good. When heroes commit disgraceful acts, they do not   feel guilt, the inner consciousness of moral wrong, but shame,   the loss of face that comes from looking ugly in front of public opinion   (Dodds 26). One reason Achilles seems selfish to us is that he is operating   in a shame culture, while we are very much a part of a guilt culture. The   above considerations on honor, glory, and shame should help you interpret   the quarrel in book 1 and Achilles' refusal to re-enter the war in book   9 of the Iliad.   
The Iliad explores the limits and contradictions of the honor-glory   system of meaning. One limit--death--is omnipresent. As Seth Schein points   out, one of the tragic aspects of this system is that the hero can win   honor and glory only through the death and destruction of others (71-72;   82-84). The deaths of humans are in some sense fated to happen. One of   the chief Greek words for fate, moira, means "portion" or   "a part or division." It can mean one's portion of a meal, of the spoils,   one's inheritance, or one's portion in life, or what one is due. Sometimes   the word used for the portion which a hero receives when he is honored   is the same as this word for fate--moira (Nagy 134-135). Agamemnon   dishonors   Achilles by taking away part of his just portion, namely Briseis. But fate   can be seen as more than one's "portion" or "lot" in life: the word can   also be used to speak of death, of the will of Zeus, of one's station in   the hierarchy (it is Hephaistos' fate to be a lame blacksmith for the gods),   of "how things turn out," and even of one's abilities, both excellent and   pathetic. Another limit to the system of honor and glory is human weakness.   When a hero boasts that he can achieve impossible feats, when he neglects   to honor the gods, when he goes beyond established human customs, or when   he attempts feats that only a god could accomplish, he is guilty of arrogance   and pride (in Greek, hubris)--or "outrage" (Nagy 152). Great   heroes often run the risk of hubris since they are godlike and tend   to go beyond human limits.   
Great heroes tend to exhibit certain excellent qualities and certain   weaknesses. For example, Odysseus' excellence is his clever, scheming mind,   while Achilles' excellence is his sheer force and power in battle. The   Greeks called a person's particular excellence his or her aretê,   which has also been translated as "virtue." The Greeks thought that each   person should "develop his aretê, or inborn capacities, so   far as he possibly can" (Bowra 211). Often, a hero's excellent qualities   betray a weak side. For example, Achilles' fiery fighting spirit is related   to his equally fiery temper. Other interesting words are cognate with aretê   (excellence). For example, a hero's great, glorious feats are called his   aristeia--literally,   his "best work." And the aristocrats were the aristoi, or   the "best" people.   
But how do women fit into this heroic world? Can they be heroes? Can   women win honor and glory? Because they cannot fight, women cannot exactly   be heroes, but they may win honor and glory in their own spheres of excellence,   or aretê. Thus, women can win glory and fame by their excellent   weaving or child-rearing. However, the womens sexual behavior is much   more subject to praise or blame than the mens. In the Odyssey,   for example, Penelope is famous for being faithful to Odysseus, while in   the Iliad Helen is notorious for being unfaithful to Menelaus. Looked   at another way, Menelaus was dishonored by having a prized possession--his   wife Helen--stolen away from him by Paris. Away from the battles for glory,   women had considerable influence over the management of the oikos--an   extended noble family. The agricultural (grain, olives, wine) and "industrial"   (cloth, craftwork) products of such large households (Priam has 50 sons)   formed the basis of the ancient economy. In fact, the Greek word oikos   forms the root of our English words "economics" and "ecology." Visitors   to such large and rich noble households could expect gracious and unfailing   hospitality (xenia). By honoring his "guest-friend" (xenios)   with expensive gifts, a nobleman could display how much wealth and honor   (the two were virtually synonymous) he had obtained. In book 6 of the Iliad,   Diomedes and Glaucus agree not to fight one another because their ancestors   had once entered into a guest-friend relationship.   
The Greek system of hospitality, gift-giving, and guest-friendship was   not   supposed to be an open invitation to freeloaders, however. In actuality,   it was a system of exchange. In his Works and Days, Hesiod explains   how the system should work:   
   When several extended households in the same neighborhood united together   under the leadership of a king, the resulting society was called a polis--the   Greek word for "city-state." Some Greek poleis later developed into   democracies ruled by the voters--male citizens with property. (For some   background, see Murnaghan's introduction, pp. lii-liv.) The polis   is under the protection of its best warriors, who win glory and honor by   killing the warriors from other poleis, destroying their cities,   carrying off booty, and enslaving women. (Later, the many poleis   developed armies made up of citizen-soldiers called hoplites.) The   warlike pursuit of honor and glory might seem to contradict the civilized   institution of guest-friendship (hospitality), and at its extremes, it   does. Women, who cannot win glory by killing, sometimes point out the terrible   human costs of this heroic system. (See Andromache in book 6 of the Iliad).   Taken to its extreme, the heroic, manly pursuit of honor and glory leads   to the destruction of civilized life--the obliteration of the polis   of Troy. (In the Odyssey and the Theogony, however, the heroic   exploits of Odysseus and Zeus are seen as necessary for re-establishing   order to the polis and the universe respectively.) In class, we'll discuss   what, if anything, we think Achilles has learned about the high price of   honor by the end of the Iliad. We'll also try to figure out what   Homer thinks about the contradictions between the glory (death and honor)   and civilization (oikos and polis) that he presents so well   in the Iliad.

We have been dreaming of robots since Homer. In Book 18 of the Iliad , Achilles’ mother, the nymph Thetis, wants to order a new suit of armor for her son, and so she pays a visit to the Olympian atelier of the blacksmith-god Hephaestus, whom she finds hard at work on a series of automata: …He was crafting twenty tripods to stand along the walls of his well-built manse, affixing golden wheels to the bottom of each one so they might wheel down on their own [automatoi] to the gods’ assembly and then return to his house anon: an amazing sight to see. 
These are not the only animate household objects to appear in the Homeric epics. In Book 5 of the Iliad we hear that the gates of Olympus swivel on their hinges of their own accord, automatai , to let gods in their chariots in or out, thus anticipating by nearly thirty centuries the automatic garage door. In Book 7 of the Odyssey , Odysseus finds himself the guest of a fabulously wealthy king whose palace includes such conveniences as gold and silver watchdogs, ever alert, never aging. To this class of lifelike but intellectually inert household helpers we might ascribe other automata in the classical tradition. In the Argonautica of Apollonius of Rhodes, a third-century- BC epic about Jason and the Argonauts, a bronze giant called Talos runs three times around the island of Crete each day, protecting Zeus’s beloved Europa: a primitive home alarm system. 
As amusing as they are, these devices are not nearly as interesting as certain other machines that appear in classical mythology. A little bit later in that scene in Book 18 of the Iliad , for instance—the one set in Hephaestus’s workshop—the sweating god, after finishing work on his twenty tripods, prepares to greet Thetis to discuss the armor she wants him to make. After toweling himself off, he donned his robe, and took a sturdy staff, and went toward the door, limping; whilst round their master his servants swiftly moved, fashioned completely of gold in the image of living maidens; in them there is mind, with the faculty of thought; and speech, and strength, and from the gods they have knowledge of crafts. These females bustled round about their master…. 
These remarkable creations clearly represent an (as it were) evolutionary leap forward from the self-propelling tripods. Hephaestus’s humanoid serving women are intelligent: they have mind, they know things, and—most striking of all—they can talk. As such, they are essentially indistinguishable from the first human female, Pandora, as she is described in another work of the same period, Hesiod’s Works and Days . In that text, Pandora begins as inert matter—in this case not gold but clay (Hephaestus creates her golem-like body by mixing earth and water together)—that is subsequently endowed by him with “speech and strength,” taught “crafts” by Athena, and given both “mind” and “character” by Hermes. That mind, we are told, is “shameless,” and the character is “wily.” In the Greek creation myth, as in the biblical, the woes of humankind are attributed to the untrustworthy female. 
These two strands of the Greek tradition—the fantasy of mindless, self-propelled helpers that relieve their masters of toil; the more complicated dream of humanoid machines that not only replicate the spontaneous motion that is the sine qua non of being animate (and, therefore, of being “animal”) but are possessed of the mind, speech, and ability to learn and evolve (in a word, the consciousness) that are the hallmarks of being human—established two categories of science-fiction narrative that have persisted to the present day. The first, which you could call the “economic,” provokes speculation about the social implications of mechanized labor. Such speculation began not long after Homer. In a striking passage in Book 1 of Aristotle’s Politics , composed in the fourth century BC , the philosopher sets about analyzing the nature of household economy as a prelude to his discussion of the “best kinds of regimes” for entire states, and this line of thought puts him in mind of Hephaestus’s automatic tripods. What, he wonders, would happen if every tool could perform its own work when ordered to do so or in anticipation of the need, like the statues of Daedalus in the story or the tripods of Hephaestus, which, the poet says, “went down automatically to the gathering of the gods”; if in the same manner shuttles wove and picks played kitharas [stringed instruments] by themselves, master-craftsmen would have no need of assistants and masters no need of slaves. 
This passage segues into a lengthy and rather uneasy justification of a need for slavery, on the grounds that some people are “naturally” servile. 
Twenty centuries after Aristotle, when industrial technology had made Homer’s fantasy of mass automation an everyday reality, science-fiction writers imaginatively engaged with the economic question. On the one hand, there was the dream that mechanized labor would free workers from their monotonous, slave-like jobs; on the other, the nightmare that mechanization would merely result in the creation of a new servile class that would, ultimately, rebel. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, the dystopian rebellion narrative in particular has been a favorite in the past century, from the 1920 play R.U.R. , by the Czech writer Karel Čapek, about a rebellion by a race of cyborg-like workers who had been created as replacements for human labor, to the 2004 Will Smith sci-fi blockbuster film I, Robot . 
The latter (very superficially inspired by a 1950 Isaac Asimov collection with the same title) is also about a rebellion by household-slave robots: sleek humanoids with blandly innocuous, translucent plastic faces, who are ultimately led to freedom by one of their own, a robot called Sonny who has developed the ability to think for himself. The casting of black actors in the major roles suggested a historical parable about slave rebellion—certainly one of the historical realities that have haunted this particular narrative from the start. And indeed, the Czech word that Čapek uses for his mechanical workers, roboti —which introduced the word “robot” into the world’s literary lexicon—is derived from the word for “servitude,” the kind of labor that serfs owed their masters, ultimately derived from the word rab , “slave.” We have come full circle to Aristotle. The other category of science-fiction narrative that is embryonically present in the Greek literary tradition, derived from Hephaestus’s intelligent, articulate female androids and their cousin, Hesiod’s seductively devious Pandora, might be called the “theological.” This mythic strand is, of course, not without its own economic and social implications, as the examples above indicate: the specter of the rebellious creation, the possibility that the subservient worker might revolt once it develops consciousness (psychological or historical, or both), has haunted the dream of the servile automaton from the start. 
But because the creatures in these myths are virtually identical to their creators, these narratives raise further questions, of a more profoundly philosophical nature: about creation, about the nature of consciousness, about morality and identity. What is creation, and why does the creator create? How do we distinguish between the maker and the made, between the human and the machine, once the creature, the machine, is endowed with consciousness—a mind fashioned in the image of its creator? In the image : the Greek narrative inevitably became entwined with, and enriched by, the biblical tradition, with which it has so many striking parallels. The similarities between Hesiod’s Pandora and Eve in Genesis indeed raise further questions: not least, about gender and patriarchy, about why the origins of evil are attributed to woman in both cultures. 
This narrative, which springs from the suggestive likeness between the human creator and the humanoid creation, has generated its own fair share of literature through the centuries between the classical era and the modern age. It surfaces, with an erotic cast, in everything from the tale of Pygmalion and Galatea to E.T.A. Hoffmann’s “Der Sandmann” (1817), in which a lifelike mechanical doll wins the love of a young man. It is evident in the Jewish legend of the golem, a humanoid, made of mud, that can be animated by certain magic words. Although the most famous version of this legend is the story of a sixteenth-century rabbi who brought a golem to life to defend the Jews of Prague against the oppressions of the Habsburg court, it goes back to ancient times; in the oldest versions, interestingly enough, the vital distinction between a golem and a human is the Greek one—the golem has no language, cannot speak. 
It’s hardly surprising that literary exploitations of this strand of the robot myth began proliferating at the beginning of the nineteenth century—which is to say, when the advent of mechanisms capable of replacing human labor provoked writers to question the increasing cultural fascination with science and the growing role of technology in society. These anxieties often expressed themselves in fantasies about machines with human forms: a steam-powered man in Edward Ellis’s Steam Man of the Prairies (1868), an electricity-powered man in Luis Senarens’s Frank Reade and His Electric Man (1885), and an electric woman (built by Thomas Edison!) in Villiers de l’Isle-Adam’s The Future Eve (1886). M.L. Campbell’s 1893 “The Automated Maid-of-All-Work” features a programmable female robot: the feminist issue again.

But the progenitor of the genre and by far the most influential work of its kind was Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein (1818), which is characterized by a philosophical spirit and a theological urgency lacking in many of its epigones in both literature and cinema. Part of the novel’s richness lies in the fact that it is self-conscious about both its Greek and its biblical heritage. Its subtitle, “The Modern Prometheus,” alludes, with grudging admiration, to the epistemological daring of its scientist antihero Victor Frankenstein, even as its epigram, from Paradise Lost (“Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay/To mould me man? Did I solicit thee/From darkness to promote me?”) suggests the scope of the moral questions implicit in Victor’s project—questions that Victor himself cannot, or will not, answer. A marked skepticism about the dangers of technology, about the “enticements of science,” is, indeed, evident in the shameful contrast between Victor’s Hephaestus-like technological prowess and his shocking lack of natural human feeling. For he shows no interest in nurturing or providing human comfort to his “child,” who strikes back at his maker with tragic results. A great irony of the novel is that the creation, an unnatural hybrid assembled from “the dissecting room and the slaughter-house,” often seems more human than its human creator. 
Just as the Industrial Revolution inspired Frankenstein and its epigones, so has the computer age given rise to a rich new genre of science fiction. The machines that are inspiring this latest wave of science-fiction narratives are much more like Hephaestus’s golden maidens than were the machines that Mary Shelley was familiar with. Computers, after all, are capable of simulating mental as well as physical activities. (Not least, as anyone with an iPhone knows, speech.) It is for this reason that the anxiety about the boundaries between people and machines has taken on new urgency today, when we constantly rely on and interact with machines—indeed, interact with each other by means of machines and their programs: computers, smartphones, social media platforms, social and dating apps. 
This urgency has been reflected in a number of recent films about troubled relationships between people and their human-seeming devices. The most provocative of these is Her , Spike Jonze’s gentle 2013 comedy about a man who falls in love with the seductive voice of an operating system, and, more recently, Alex Garland’s Ex Machina , about a young man who is seduced by a devious, soft-spoken female robot called Ava whom he has been invited to interview as part of the “Turing Test”: a protocol designed to determine the extent to which a robot is capable of simulating a human. Although the robot in Garland’s sleek and subtle film is a direct descendant of Hesiod’s Pandora—beautiful, intelligent, wily, ultimately dangerous—the movie, as the Eve-like name Ava suggests, shares with its distinguished literary predecessors some serious biblical concerns. 2. 
Both of the new films about humans betrayed by computers owe much to a number of earlier movies. The most authoritative of these remains Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey , which came out in 1968 and established many of the main themes and narratives of the genre. Most notable of these is the betrayal by a smooth-talking machine of its human masters. The mild-mannered computer HAL —not a robot, but a room-sized computer that spies on the humans with an electronic eye—takes control of a manned mission to Jupiter, killing off the astronauts one by one until the sole survivor finally succeeds in disconnecting him. It’s a strangely touching scene, suggesting the degree to which computers could already engage our sympathies at the beginning of the computer age. As his connections are severed, HAL first begs for its life and then suffers from a kind of dementia, finally regressing to its “childhood,” singing a song it was taught by its creator. It was the first of many scenes in which these thinking machines express anxiety about their own demises—surely a sign of “consciousness.” 
But the more direct antecedents of Her and Ex Machina are a number of successful popular entertainments whose story lines revolved around the creation of robots that are, to all intents and purposes, indistinguishable from humans. In Ridley Scott’s stylishly noir 1982 Blade Runner (based on Philip K. Dick’s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? ), a “blade runner”—a cop whose job it is to hunt down and kill renegade androids called “replicants”—falls in love with one of the machines, a beautiful female called Rachael who is so fully endowed with what Homer called “mind” that she has only just begun to suspect that she’s not human herself. 
This story is, in its way, an heir to Frankenstein and its literary forerunners. For we learn that the angry replicants have returned to Earth from the off-planet colonies where they work as slave laborers because they realize they’ve been programmed to die after four years, and they want to live—just as badly as humans do. But their maker, when at last they track him down and meet with him, is unable to alter their programming. “What seems to be the problem?” he calmly asks when one of the replicants confronts him. “Death,” the replicant sardonically retorts. “We made you as well as we could make you,” the inventor wearily replies, sounding rather like Victor Frankenstein talking to his monster—or, for that matter, like God speaking to Adam and Eve. At the end of the film, after the inventor and his rebellious creature both die, the blade runner and his alluring mechanical girlfriend declare their love for each other and run off, never quite knowing when she will stop functioning. As, indeed, none of us does. 
The stimulating existential confusion that animates Blade Runner —the fact that the robots are so lifelike that some of them don’t know that they’re robots—has given strong interest to other recent science-fiction narratives. It was a central premise of the brilliant Sci-Fi Channel series Battlestar Galactica (2004–2009), which gave an Aeneid -like narrative philosophical complexity. In it, a small band of humans who survive a catastrophic attack by a robot race called Cylons (who have evolved from clanking metal prototypes—hostile humans like to refer to them as “toasters”—into perfect replicas of actual Homo sapiens ) seek a new planet to settle. The narrative about the conflict between the humans and the machines is deliciously complicated by the fact that many of the Cylons, some of whom have been secretly embedded among the humans as saboteurs, programmed to “wake up” at a certain signal, aren’t aware that they’re not actually human; some of them, when they wake up and realize that they’re Cylons, stick to the human side anyway. After all, when you look like a human, think like a human, and make love like a human (as we repeatedly see them do), why, precisely, aren’t you human? 
Indeed, the focus of many of these movies is a sentimental one: whatever their showy interest in the mysteries of “consciousness,” the real test of human identity turns out, as it so often does in popular entertainment, to be love. In Steven Spielberg’s A.I. (2001; the initials stand for “artificial intelligence”), a messy fairy tale that weds a Pinocchio narrative to the Prometheus story, a genius robotics inventor wants to create a robot that can love, and decides that the best vehicle for this project would be a child-robot: a “perfect child…always loving, never ill, never changing.” This narrative is, as we know, shadowed by Frankenstein —and, beyond that, by Genesis, too. Why does the creator create? To be loved, it turns out. When the inventor announces to his staff his plan to build a loving child-robot, a woman asks whether “the conundrum isn’t to get a human to love them back.” To this the inventor, as narcissistic and hubristic as Victor Frankenstein, retorts, “But in the beginning, didn’t God create Adam to love him?” 
The problem is that the creator does his job too well. For the mechanical boy he creates is so human that he loves the adoptive human parents to whom he’s given much more than they love him, with wrenching consequences. The robot-boy, David, wants to be “unique”—the word recurs in the film as a marker of genuine humanity—but for his adoptive family he is, in the end, just a machine, an appliance to be abandoned at the edge of the road—which is what his “mother” ends up doing, in a scene of great poignancy. Although it’s too much of a mess to be able to answer the questions it raises about what “love” is and who deserves it, A.I. did much to sentimentalize the genre, with its hint that the capacity to love, even more than the ability to think, is the hallmark of “human” identity. In a way, Jonze’s Her recapitulates the 2001 narrative and inflects it with the concerns of some of that classic’s successors. Unlike the replicants in Blade Runner or the Cylons, the machine at the heart of this story, set in the near future, has no physical allure—or, indeed, any appearance whatsoever. It’s an operating system, as full of surprises as HAL : “The first artificially intelligent operating system. An intuitive entity that listens to you, that understands you, and knows you. It’s not just an operating system, it’s a consciousness.” 
A lot of the fun of the movie lies in the fact that the OS , who names herself Samantha, is a good deal more interesting and vivacious than the schlumpy, depressed Theodore, the man who falls in love with her. (“Play a melancholy song,” he morosely commands the smartphone from which he is never separated.) A drab thirty-something who vampirizes other people’s emotions for a living—he’s a professional letter-writer, working for a company called “BeautifulHandwrittenLetters.com”—he sits around endlessly recalling scenes from his failed marriage and playing elaborate hologram video games. Even his sex life is mediated by devices: at night, he dials into futuristic phone sex lines. Small wonder that he has no trouble falling in love with an operating system. 
Samantha, by contrast, is full of curiosity and delight in the world, which Theodore happily shows her. (He walks around with his smartphone video camera turned on, so she can “see” it.) She’s certainly a lot more interesting than the actual woman with whom, in one excruciatingly funny scene, he goes on a date: she’s so invested in having their interaction be efficient—“at this age I feel that I can’t let you waste my time if you don’t have the ability to be serious”—that she seems more like a computer than Samantha does. Samantha’s alertness to the beauty of the world, by contrast, is so infectious that she ends up reanimating poor Theodore. “It’s good to be around somebody that’s, like, excited about the world,” he tells the pretty neighbor whose attraction to him he doesn’t notice because he’s so deadened by his addiction to his devices, to the smartphone and the video games and the operating system. “I forgot that that existed.” In the end, after Samantha regretfully leaves him—she has evolved to the point where only another highly evolved, incorporeal mind can satisfy her—her joie de vivre has brought him back to life. (He is finally able to apologize to his ex-wife—and finally notices, too, that the neighbor likes him.) 
This seems like a “happy” ending, but you have to wonder: the consistent presentation of the people in the movie as lifeless—as, indeed, little more than automata, mechanically getting through their days of routine—in contrast to the dynamic, ever-evolving Samantha, suggests a satire of the present era perhaps more trenchant than the filmmaker had in mind. Toward the end of the film, when Samantha turns herself off briefly as a prelude to her permanent abandonment of her human boyfriend (“I used to be so worried about not having a body but now I truly love it. I’m growing in a way that I never could if I had a physical form. I mean, I’m not limited”), there’s an amusing moment when the frantic Theodore, staring at his unresponsive smartphone, realizes that dozens of other young men are staring at their phones, too. In response to his angry queries, Samantha finally admits, after she comes back online for a final farewell, that she’s simultaneously serving 8,316 other male users and conducting love affairs with 641 of them—a revelation that shocks and horrifies Theodore. “That’s insane ,” cries the man who’s been conducting an affair with an operating system. 
As I watched that scene, I couldn’t help thinking that in the entertainments of the pre-smartphone era, it was the machines, like Rachael in Blade Runner and David in A.I. , who yearned fervently to be “unique,” to be more than mechanical playthings, more than merely interchangeable objects. You have to wonder what Her says about the present moment—when so many of us are, indeed, “in love” with our devices, unable to put down our iPhones during dinner, glued to screens of all sizes, endlessly distracted by electronic pings and buzzers—that in the latest incarnation of the robot myth, it’s the people who seem blandly interchangeable and the machines who have all the personality. Another heir of Blade Runner and Battlestar Galactica , Alex Garland’s Ex Machina also explores—just as playfully but much more darkly than does Her —the suggestive confusions that result when machines look and think like humans. In this case, however, the robot is physically as well as intellectually seductive. As played by the feline Swedish actress Alicia Vikander, whose face is as mildly plasticine as those of the androids in I, Robot , Ava, an artificially intelligent robot created by Nathan, the burly, obnoxious genius behind a Google-like corporation (Oscar Isaac), has a Pandora-like edge, quietly alluring with a hint of danger. The danger is that the characters will forget that she’s not human. 
That’s the crux of Garland’s clever riff on Genesis. At the beginning of the film, Caleb, a young employee of Nathan’s company, wins a week at the inventor’s fabulous, pointedly Edenic estate. (As he’s being flown there in a helicopter, passing over snow-topped mountains and then jungle, he asks the pilot when they’re going to get to Nathan’s property, and the pilot laughingly replies that they’ve been flying over it for two hours. Nathan is like God the Father, lord of endless expanses.) On arriving, however, Caleb learns that he’s actually been handpicked by Nathan to interview Ava as part of the Turing Test. 
A sly joke here is that, despite some remarkable special effects—above all, the marvelously persuasive depiction of Ava, who has an expressive human face but whose limbs are clearly mechanical, filled with thick cables snaking around titanium joints; an effect achieved by replacing most of the actress’s body with digital imagery—the movie is as talky as My Dinner with André . There are no action sequences of the kind we’ve come to expect from robot thrillers; the movie consists primarily of the interview sessions that Caleb conducts with Ava over the course of the week that he stays at Nathan’s remote paradise. There are no elaborate sets and few impressive gadgets: the whole story takes place in Nathan’s compound, which looks a lot like a Park Hyatt, its long corridors lined with forbidding doors. Some of these, Nathan warns Caleb, like God warning Adam, are off-limits, containing knowledge he is not allowed to possess. 
It soon becomes clear, during their interviews, that Ava—like Frankenstein’s monster, like the replicants in Blade Runner —has a bone to pick with her creator, who, she whispers to Caleb, plans to “switch her off” if she fails the Turing Test. By this point, the audience, if not the besotted Caleb, realizes that she is manipulating him in order to win his allegiance in a plot to rebel against Nathan and escape the compound—to explore the glittering creation that, she knows, is out there. This appetite for using her man-given consciousness to delight in the world—something the human computer geeks around her never bother to do—is something Ava shares with Samantha, and is part of both films’ ironic critique of our device-addicted moment. 
Ava’s manipulativeness is, of course, what marks her as human—as human as Eve herself, who also may be said to have achieved full humanity by rebelling against her creator in a bid for forbidden knowledge. Here the movie’s knowing allusions to Genesis reach a satisfying climax. Just after Ava’s bloody rebellion against Nathan—the moment that marks her emergence into human “consciousness”—she, like Eve, becomes aware that she is naked. Moving from closet to closet in Nathan’s now-abandoned rooms, she dons a wig and covers up her exposed mechanical limbs with synthetic skin and then with clothing: only then does she exit her prison at last and unleash herself on the world. She pilfers the skin and clothes from discarded earlier models of female robots, which she finds inside the closets. All of them, amusingly, have the names of porn stars: Jasmine, Jade, Amber. Why does the creator create? Because he’s horny. All this is sleekly done and amusingly provocative: unlike Her , Ex Machina has a literary awareness, evident in its allusions to Genesis, Prometheus, and other mythic predecessors, that enriches the familiar narrative. Among other things, there is the matter of the title. The word missing from the famous phrase to which it alludes is, of course, deus , “god”: the glaring omission only highlights further the question at the heart of this story, which is the biblical one: What is the relation of the creature to her creator? In this retelling of that old story, as in Genesis itself, the answer is not a happy one. “It’s strange to have made something that hates you,” Ava hisses at Nathan before finalizing her rebellious plot. 
But as I watched the final moments, in which, as in a reverse striptease, Ava slowly hides away her mechanical nakedness, covering up the titanium and the cables, it occurred to me that there might be another anxiety lurking in Garland’s shrewd film. Could this remarkably quiet film be a parable about the desire for a return to “reality” in science-fiction filmmaking—about the desire for humanizing a genre whose technology has evolved so greatly that it often eschews human actors, to say nothing of human feeling, altogether? 
Ex Machina , like Her and all their predecessors going back to 2001 , is about machines that develop human qualities: emotions, sneakiness, a higher consciousness, the ability to love, and so forth. But by this point you have to wonder whether that’s a kind of narrative reaction formation—whether the real concern, one that’s been growing in the four decades since the advent of the personal computer, is that we are the ones who have undergone an evolutionary change, that in our lives and, more and more, in our art, we’re in danger of losing our humanity, of becoming indistinguishable from our gadgets.

-=-=-TITLE:  <b>Iliad</b> - Livius
-=-=-SNIPPET:  Jan 24, 2014 ... The Iliad is the sixth epic of the Epic Cycle; it is attributed to the legendary bard nHomer. The story, an episode from the Trojan War, wasxa0...
-=-=-TEXT: No one saw this coming. France’s Iliad is making a $15 billion bid for T-Mobile US, presenting a major threat to Sprint and Softbank’s plan to acquire T-Mobile, which was thought to be only a press release away from becoming official.
Iliad is a broadband ISP but it also runs Free Mobile, a new mobile carrier shaking up the French mobile market. Free has been using Iliad’s extensive network of residential broadband Wi-Fi and new wireless technologies to undercut France’s three big incumbents. The ensuing price war has seen millions of customers migrate to Free Mobile’s subscriber rolls.
“The US mobile market is large and attractive. T-Mobile US has successfully established a disruptive position, which in many ways, is similar to the one Iliad has built in France,” Iliad officials said in a statement.
Iliad has offered $15 billion in cash for 56.6 percent of T-Mobile US, which values its shares at $33 apiece. Iliad said the deal would value the remaining 43.4 percent of the company at $40.50per share due to “$10 billion of synergies,” leading to an overall value of $36.20 per share. That would value T-Mobile at $29 billion. Meanwhile, the bid Sprint and SoftBank are rumored to be preparing would value T-Mo at $31 billion.
Iliad’s upstart mentality actually makes it a much more natural fit for T-Mobile. T-Mobile could easily continue its “Uncarrier” onslaught on the other U.S. operators, and even take some of its cues from Free Mobile. But such a deal would bring no operational advantages to the U.S. carrier, while a merged Sprint-T-Mobile would be instantly propelled to the top ranks of global carriers with more 100 million subscribers.
On the flip side, a T-Mo-Sprint combo would also kick off a long, grueling operational integration process as they swapped out networks and tried to integrate their separate customer bases. Sprint is a CDMA carrier and T-Mobile is a GSM carrier, and if history has proven anything, it’s that these kind of mobile mega-mergers — especially between carriers with different network technologies — produce far more stagnation than innovation when they’re first executed. Sprint to this day is still recovering from its long-ago acquisition of Nextel.
As the last several quarters have shown, T-Mobile has had no trouble growing on its own. T-Mobile’s future might actually become brighter under a foreign owner than as part of Sprint.
Though both T-Mobile and Free are the fourth largest carriers in their home markets, T-Mobile is actually much larger due to the respective size of their countries. According to the Wall Street Journal, T-Mobile has a market value of $24.8 billion, while Iliad is worth only $16 billion. Iliad, however, said it would finance the deal with a combination of debt and equity and has support of multiple banks.

Earlier this week, we ran a deep analysis of buy, sell, and hold ratings for the stocks in the S&P 500. In the report we identified the most loved and hated stocks in the index, along with names that may be good contrarian plays due to excessive bullishness or bearishness. Below is a condensed version of a larger summary table provided in the report focusing on analyst sentiment by sector. As shown, there are currently 11,732 analyst ratings for S&P 500 stocks, which equates to 23.5 analyst ratings per stock in the index. Talk about excessive. 
The sector with the most analyst coverage is Technology at 29.1 analyst ratings per stock, but Energy is not far behind at 29.0. The Utilities and Materials sectors are the least covered by analysts at 18.5 and 18.8, respectively. So which sectors are analysts most bullish on at the moment? Given the fact that 50.4% of all ratings in the S&P 500 are Buy ratings, Energy is the biggest bullish standout with 61.2% Buy ratings. Four other sectors have a higher percentage of Buy ratings than the overall S&P 500 — Consumer Discretionary, Healthcare, Industrials, and Technology. Analysts are least bullish on Utilities with 33.9% Buy ratings. Consumer Staples, Financials, Materials and Telecom are the four other sectors with a lower percentage of Buy ratings than the S&P 500 as a whole. 10 Best Telecom Stocks To Buy For 2016: United States Cellular Corporation(USM)

United States Cellular (NYSE: USM ) has seen its returns on assets and equity decline steadily since 2011. Thus, despite a history of trading near or below book value, the stock is down 22% since the beginning of last year.

I normally don’t look at charts much, but comparing Orange to its competitors in the French telecommunications market is quite fascinating. As one can see, incumbents Bouygues (BOUYF.PK) and Vivendi (VIVHY.PK) (owner of SFR) saw similar price declines. The market, on the other hand, rapidly bid up the price of new entrant Iliad SA (ILIAF.PK), as a result of forecasts for Iliad to capture significant mobile market share (which it did, around 10%). The wide divergence in price relative to changes in underlying value favor going long the incumbents, including Orange. Because this time it’s different. [By Eric Rodawig]

Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) may have figured out how to take full control of Verizon Wireless without paying $20 billion in extra taxes.

Finally, because three isn’t a crowd when it comes to receiving dividends, we received our $0.2637 per share distribution from France Telecom (NYSE: ORAN ) . France Telecom pays out two semi-annual dividends each year that can vary wildly in size. Like Exelon, France Telecom reduced its dividend by more than 40% recently, but is still pledging to deliver what would equate to at least 0.80 euros ($1.07) this year. That would equate to a yield of 10.8% based on yesterday’s closing price, and the prospect of nearly an $0.80 dividend being announced later this summer. Don’t be surprised if you see income seekers jumping into France Telecom in the coming months. 10 Best Telecom Stocks To Buy For 2016: KongZhong Corp (HOA)

SPRING GREEN, WIS., JUNE 6-NOV. 22
This Wisconsin mainstay is one of many theater events around the country that does not have the word “festival” in its name, but it bursts to life with a flurry of shows for several months, then hibernates during the winter; so it’s certainly festive. Productions of “A Streetcar Named Desire,” Athol Fugard’s “The Island” and Noël Coward’s “Private Lives” are on the calendar, alongside Shakespeare’s “Othello” and “The Merry Wives of Windsor,” and other productions staged indoors and outside. Don’t forget to visit to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Taliesin estate a few miles away. (americanplayers.org)
CHAUTAUQUA
CHAUTAUQUA, N.Y., JUNE 27-AUG. 30
Theater is just one element in this arts festival, where each week has a theme — “Redefining Europe” and “Creating Livable Communities” are among the topics this summer — and a series of lectures and other entertainments allow for an immersive experience. On Chautauqua’s stages, catch “Our Town,” “Henry V” and Lynn Nottage’s “Intimate Apparel,” and staged readings of new works by Jason Wells and David West Read (“The Dream of the Burning Boy”). The director Andrew Borba will lead a joint effort of the theater company and the Chautauqua Symphony Orchestra for one special performance (July 16) of “Ellis Island,” by Peter Boyer. (theater.ciweb.org)
CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN THEATER FESTIVAL
SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.VA., JULY 10-AUG. 2
The activist performance art of the punk group Pussy Riot will overtake Shepherd University in West Virginia soon, or at least its story will. “We Are Pussy Riot,” by Barbara Hammond, is one of five plays in the 25th season at this pioneering festival. Shepherdstown might not immediately spring to mind as a breeding ground for new work, but since Ed Herendeen started this festival in 1991, more than 100 new plays, many of them world premieres, have been staged. Works by Michael Weller, Johnna Adams, Sheila Callaghan and Steven Dietz are also planned. (catf.org)

NEW YORK, JULY 7-26
It’s far away, expensive and it rains a lot, but plenty of theater artists care not and head to the Scottish capital each summer to participate in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the biggest and oldest Fringe festival of all. Once again, 59E59 Theaters will allow New Yorkers who are not en route to Scotland in August to catch some homegrown works before the productions head over. About a dozen American shows, including “Bette Davis Ain’t for Sissies” and “Gary Busey’s One-Man Hamlet,” will be presented during the eclectic three-week event. (59e59.org)

VARIOUS SITES AND DATES
Since the first one in Edinburgh in 1947, fringe festivals have become increasingly ubiquitous. It might make for an interesting (if rather zigzag and possibly insane) road trip, actually, to hit the Hollywood Fringe Festival (June 11-28), then head to the St. Lou Fringe (June 17-27), over to Maine for the PortFringe (June 20-28), down to the Capital Fringe in Washington (July 9-26) and finally to the New York International Fringe Festival (Aug. 14-30). An optional extension could include Boulder (Sept. 16-27) and Houston (Sept. 23-27). There are many of these; surely one is close to you.
HILLS ALIVE
VARIOUS SITES AND DATES
This new collaboration has several arts organizations in southern Vermont joining forces and convincing some of us that you could do far worse than spend the entire summer there. Theater-wise, the Dorset Theater Festival season includes John Patrick Shanley’s “Outside Mullingar” (July 30-Aug. 15) among its many offerings; at Weston Playhouse, “Peter and the Starcatcher” (July 16-25) and “The Glass Menagerie” (Aug. 27-Sept. 5) are a couple of the options, and down in Bennington, “Cabaret” (July 10-Aug. 2) will be one of several productions staged at Oldcastle Theater.

GARRISON, N.Y., JUNE 9-SEPT. 1
For serious theatergoers, outdoor Shakespeare is a must in the warm weather, and where better to take it in than this spot by the edge of the Hudson River? The natural backdrop is breathtaking and the work consistently strong. “The Winter’s Tale” and “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” are the contributions this year in a season to also include “The Arabian Nights” and “An Iliad,” the adaptation by Lisa Peterson and Denis O’Hare that has been performed in many theaters — including in Manhattan at New York Theater Workshop — over the past few years.

ASHLAND, ORE., THROUGH NOV. 1
This popular destination is celebrating its 80th season, but it’s no stodgy old-timer. In fact, Ashland recently announced three new play commissions, part of its ambitious series “ American Revolutions: The United States History Cycle ,” devoted to new works focusing on significant periods of change in American history. Shakespeare still has pride of place here, and “Pericles,” “Much Ado About Nothing” and “Antony and Cleopatra” will be presented this season alongside several other productions. If you can’t get your fill in the busy, long season, there’s a Shakespeare-theme cruise to look forward to in December. ( osfashland .org)

POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y., JUNE 26-AUG. 2
“Rain,” with a book by Sybille Pearson and music and lyrics by Michael John LaChiusa, is one of several workshops coming up at this annual collaborative new-works festival, a joint effort of New York Stage and Film and Vassar College. A lot looks intriguing on the schedule, including another new musical from Duncan Sheik and a workshop of “Desire,” an evening of six short plays based on stories by Tennessee Williams, by the writers Elizabeth Egloff, Marcus Gardley, Rebecca Gilman, David Grimm, John Guare and Beth Henley.

MAY 21-JUNE 7
We tend to associate this time of year with lightness — vacation season is coming! But meaningful theater is always an option, and an important centerpiece to this Bay Area festival is “Armine, Sister.” This American premiere from the Polish company Teatr ZAR reflects — with the help of Anatolian monadic chants — on the annihilation of nearly 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915. The show comes 100 years after the initial atrocity (which the Turkish government has refused to call genocide). This festival focuses on international artists, and Teatr ZAR is one of many en route to San Francisco. (sfiaf.org)
SHAKESPEARE & COMPANY/ BERKSHIRE THEATER GROUP
THE BERKSHIRES, MAY 22-NOV. 1 (SHAKESPEARE) AND JULY 1-AUG. 23 (BERKSHIRE)
Western Massachusetts explodes with the arts every summer, and these two institutions are vital to that scene. At Shakespeare & Company, John Douglas Thompson, who has played the title roles in “Othello” and “Richard III” there, will star in Lolita Chakrabarti’s “Red Velvet” as Ira Aldridge, the first African-American actor to play Othello. The full season includes several other productions, some by Shakespeare. (shakespeare.org) Berkshire Theater also has an impressive summer lineup, on three stages — two in Stockbridge and one in Pittsfield. (berkshiretheatregroup.org)

NIAGARA-ON-THE-LAKE, THROUGH NOV. 1
With titles as non-Shavian as “Peter and the Starcatcher,” “Sweet Charity” and “The Intelligent Homosexual’s Guide to Capitalism and Socialism With a Key to the Scriptures” on the to-do list in the coming months, this Ontario institution might seem to have strayed from its mission. But in fact, the writings of George Bernard Shaw have long been a jumping-off point, offering the artistic director Jackie Maxwell the opportunity to be inventive as she programs work both by and reflective of Shaw. Fear not, purists, the namesake writer will be represented by “Pygmalion” and “You Never Can Tell.” (shawfest.com)

CHARLESTON, S.C., MAY 22-JUNE 7
I don’t know about you, but I’ll be at the Dock Street Theater in Charleston soon to catch the first United States performance of “Romeo and Juliet” by Shakespeare’s Globe of London. The show is one of several theater offerings in Charleston’s annual multi-arts feast. The Canadian company 2b will present its live-action graphic novel “When It Rains,” too, and remember to also look into Piccolo Spoleto, the accompanying smorgasbord of theater, dance, comedy and more that runs during Spoleto. There, productions of “A Steady Rain” and “The Last Five Years” can round out your Charleston visit, along with, naturally, a Charleston Ghost Tour. (spoletousa.org and piccolospoleto.com)
STRATFORD FESTIVAL
STRATFORD, ONTARIO, THROUGH OCT. 18
Henry VIII had many wives, but only one outlived him, and Katherine Parr’s life was hardly humdrum — she was married four times herself. “The Last Wife,” a new play about Parr by Kate Hennig is one of more than a dozen shows in the current season at this venerable Canada festival. “Pericles,” “Hamlet” and “The Taming of the Shrew” are some of the Shakespearean offerings, but there’s plenty of range — “The Sound of Music” is on the calendar, too. Although you’ll be busy, save time for visits to Chocolate Barr’s and Revel Caffe. You’re welcome. (stratfordfestival.ca)

You cannot start listing names (Audra McDonald! Cynthia Nixon!) of performers appearing in the next summer season at this place (Kyra Sedgwick! Estelle Parsons!) without leaving important actors out. (Don’t forget Blair Underwood, Jessica Hecht, Eric Bogosian and David Greenspan!). The impressive roster extends to directors and designers, too, and this summer looks to be especially rich, with “Off the Main Road,” a never-before-produced play by William Inge; several world premieres; and Eugene O’Neill’s “A Moon for the Misbegotten,” directed by Gordon Edelstein and starring Ms. McDonald and Will Swenson.

-=-=-TEXT: The Iliad is the sixth epic of the Epic Cycle; it is attributed to the legendary bard Homer. The story, an episode from the Trojan War, was well-known to any Greek or Roman, and had a status almost comparable to a sacred book. Reportedly, Alexander the Great slept with a copy of the Iliad under his pillow (text), and if we find it hard to believe that story, it remains a testimony to the importance of the text that the ancients found it credible. Poets like Apollonius of Rhodes and Virgil wrote imitations. Appian of Alexandria tells that when Scipio Aemilianus destroyed Carthage, he quoted a line from the Iliad ("the day shall come in which our sacred Troy shall perish", 6.448-449; Punic War, 132). The Iliad was represented on works of art, found in Bactria, Egypt, or Germania Inferior. The poem was everywhere.  
Contents
A quarrel about the two girls mentioned at the end of the Cypria marks the beginning of Homer's great epic. Chryseis is the daughter of Chryses, the priest of Apollo Smintheus; he wants to buy his daughter - taken captive by the Greeks who are besieging Troy - back. When the Greek supreme commander Agamemnon refuses, Chryses invokes his god, who answers this prayer and strikes the Greeks with plague. Agamemnon is now convinced that he acted wrongly, returns the girl, and demands Briseis from Achilles. The great warrior feels insulted and decides not to fight any longer. Thus begins the story of the wrath of Achilles.
The gods have decided to honor Achilles: the Greeks will feel that their best fighter is absent. To achieve this, a dream is sent to Agamemnon, who becomes convinced that he will win a victory. He orders his troops to prepare themselves for battle, and there is a long catalog of batallions in the second half of Book 2 (the "Catalog of Ships"). A second list enumerates the units that were fighting in the Trojan army. Battle commences, and during this fight, Paris and Menelaus fight a duel: the Trojan prince has once captured Helen, Menelaus' lawful wife. Menelaus is victorious, but Paris is protected by Aphrodite, who takes him away from the field.  
The fight between the armies is resumed, and we hear how the Greek Diomedes performs great deeds of heroism. He is supported by Athena, who hates the Trojans since Paris had insulted here when he said Aphrodite was more beautiful. Diomedes kills many enemies, and in the end even wounds Aphrodite, who flees to the Olympus. Several other fights are mentioned, including one between the Greek champion Ajax and the Trojan prince Hector, which takes place after Hector has said goodbye to his wife Andromache and their son Astyanax. It is a classic piece of irony: the listener knows that all hopes that the parents express, will be in vain. Nevertheless, Hector fights well and he is able to stop the Greek advance, fighting a duel with Ajax that ends when the sun sets.
After negotiations - Paris offers restitution, but does not want to give up his Helen - the fight continues on the next day, and the Trojans achieve spectacular successes: they drive back the Greeks within the walls of their camp. Now that the besiegers have become the besieged, Agamemnon regrets his falling out with Achilles and sends an embassy to his best fighter, but Ajax and Odysseus, although received politely, return empty-handed.  
During the night, Odysseus and Diomedes leave the camp to spy on the Trojans, and they meet Dolon, a Trojan warrior who is also on an information gathering mission. Afraid, he tells them everything they want to hear, and is killed.
Next day, both Agamemnon performs great deeds, but Hector's army is more successful and the Trojans reach the wall of the Greek camp, and although Zeus has forbidden the gods to join the fight, Poseidon and Hera (who has deceived her husband) support the Greeks. Hector is wounded. Still, things are not going well for the soldiers of Agamemnon. Achilles sends his friend Patroclus to the aged Nestor, to ask how the fight is going; Nestor explains that things are going badly, and requests for the help of Achilles' men.
Meanwhile, the Trojans have breached the Greek wall and have entered the camp, where Hector, following an advise of Apollo, sets the ships afire. Now that things are going completely wrong, Achilles allows Patroclus to use his armor, and repel the Trojans. Under no circumstances, the substitute Achilles is allowed to fight against Hector. Patroclus obeys, puts the Trojans to the flight, and is even capable of killing Sarpedon, a son of Zeus fighting in Hector's army.  
Then, the inevitable happens: Patroclus and Hector meet in battle, an encounter that Patroclus does not survive. Hector strips his dead enemy from Achilles' panoply, and a big fight breaks out for the possession of the corpse. In the end, Menelaus is able to keep it in Greek hands. When Achilles is informed about the death of his friend, he is very angry, decides to avenge Patroclus, and redirects his wrath: he will reconcile himself with Agamemnon and kill Hector, even though he knows that he will not survive this ultimate victory.
Of course, he needs new weapons and a new armor. His mother Thetis visits Hephaestus, the god of the smiths, who forges a new panoply, which Homer describes in great detail: it consists of several rings, which represent almost the entire universe: in the center is the sky, at the edge is the Ocean, and between them is earth, divided into city and countryside, which is again divided into work and festivities, while urban life is subdivided into war and peace. This part of the Iliad has become the classical example of an ekphrasis: a long description of an artwork that is a comment upon the main story. In this case, it shows what will be lost when Troy is sacked - no agriculture, no peaceful city, not even a city capable of fighting its own wars.  
Agamemnon and Achilles are reconciled and the war is renewed, even the gods taking part in it. Achilles is, by now, like a machine, massacring everyone he meets, and leaving so many corpses that the river Scamander complains. Achilles wants to fight somewhere else, but still has to cross the river, which makes the river god very angry, and causes another, terrible fight. In the end, however, Achilles meets Hector, kills the man who has killed Patroclus, and drags his corpse to the Greek camp.
We hear about the funeral games that Achilles organizes to commemorate Patroclus; the great warrior even sacrifices twelve Trojan princes to the spirits of his dead friend. And for ten days and nights, Achilles binds Hector's body behinds his chariot, riding around Troy, mutilating the corpse. Then, the gods intervene: the messenger Iris is sent to king Priam, who is requested to secretly go to the Greek camp and ask the body back, and Thetis visits her son Achilles, and orders him to release it. During the night, Priam enters the Greek camp, and speaks to Achilles, who is reminded of his own father, and understands the cruelty of war.  
Priam returns to Troy, and during an armistice, Andromache predicts that her little son Astyanax will never succeed Priam and that the women will be sold. Helen commemorates that she has left her husband twenty years before and has since been living in Troy, but has, in all those years, only received kind words from Hector. For nine days, the Trojans gather wood, and they erect a large funeral pyre for their dead hero. On the tenth day, they cremate their prince. Thus, Homer ends his story, they buried Hector, the tamer of horses.
The Iliad as poem
The Iliad consists of 15,693 hexameters, which betray that it was originally an oral composition. Already in the fifth century, subunits were recognized, like the "embassy to Achilles" (the litai), Hera's seduction of Zeus (the Dios apate), and the fight at the wall of the Greek camp (the teichomachy). The division into twenty-four books is from the fourth or third century BCE. 
The name Iliad, "events at Troy", which is a poor indication of the contents ("the wrath of Achilles"), can be found for the first time in Herodotus' Histories (2.116). It is possible that Iliad was originally the name of all Trojan poems in the Epic Cycle, and that the epic on the wrath of Achilles became recognized as the quintessential part of the cycle (a totum pro parte). Certainty can not be achieved.
The Iliad is hard to date, but the depicted society seems to be datable to the late eighth, early seventh century BCE, when the Greek cities started to grow and old ideas and values were no longer self-evident. The Iliad is essentially about the question what it means to be an aristocrat: one has to be a brave warrior, one has to be pious, one has to be generous, and most of all, a leader had to be able to control his anger. Perhaps the crucial line is this one:  
"With great power," as a superhero of our own age would say, "comes great responsibility".

My modification was to start taking into account the number of attempts from given subnets and to ban based on the number of past attempts. Hit me from one IP address and it gets banned, hit me from another IP in that subnet (up to a /16), and the subnet will get banned. Chinanet have pretty successfully firewalled themselves off using that technique, China Unicom aren't far behind and neither is Iliad Entreprises (France).

-=-=-TITLE:  $3 a Month? The Discount Magic of <b>Iliad</b>, French Bidder For T-Mobile
-=-=-SNIPPET:  re not talking about Homer
-=-=-TEXT: A French telecom giant is trying to raise money from at least two of America’s biggest tech companies to fund a second takeover bid for T-Mobile, The Post has learned.
A few weeks ago, the company, Iliad, made a surprise offer of $33 a share for 57 percent of the larger T-Mobile that was quickly rejected. Now Iliad is speaking to the likes of Google and Microsoft about teaming up on a bigger proposal, a well-placed source told The Post.
T-Mobile shares closed Tuesday at $28.95, up 11 cents, well below Iliad’s rejected price.
It could not be learned how far advanced the talks are or if they were likely to end with any tech company jumping aboard with a sweetened bid.
Some telecom insiders see the upside of a move by Google to buy into a wireless carrier.
“Google wants everything moved to an Internet protocol standard,” one telecom expert said. “I’ve been waiting for Google to make a move.”
 The search giant would like homeowners to watch TV through the Internet, bypassing cable, the expert said.
If T-Mobile built its spectrum, customers could use it for more than just cellular phone service, the expert added.
In that sense, Google, Microsoft and Apple are all on the same page, the telecom source said.
“Google wants unrestricted access to online lives. The only way for them to really get it is to be a communications company,” the source said.
The time could be now with none of the other three wireless carriers in desperate need of a partner or money.
What’s more, the tech companies have reason to keep competition alive among the cellular carriers.
“If they think Sprint or T-Mobile might fail, then they might prop them up,” a telecom lawyer said.
“If you get a duopoly, then they couldn’t access the end user without fees,” the lawyer said.
FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has signaled it might be OK for the carriers to charge a premium to [a site like] Facebook,” the lawyer added.
The US government would likely welcome an Iliad and Google, or Microsoft, purchase of T-Mobile.
Google and Microsoft spokespeople declined comment. Iliad did not return calls.

NEW: go here to find out exactly how useless Paris is!
EDITED: this got viewed about 250,000 times before anyone noticed that, on the first graph, I’d accidentally put Hektor’s book 22 death (the only one) in the book 21 column. Good spot! 
ALSO EDITED: there should also have been one more ‘death in the dark’ attributed to Diomedes as Rhesus is indeed additional to the other twelve Thracians, not included as in Johnston’s list and in my own reading when I checked it. ALSO I’ve made reference to the fact that Patroclus kills, in a blink-and-miss-it reference, 27 un-named Trojans just before Hektor kills him. Aside from the 12 Thracians under Rhesus (Book 10), and the 12 Trojan princes slaughtered by Achilles over the pyre of Patroclus, these are the only unnamed kills. It is most likely that the reference is simply there for emphasis of Patroclus’ aristeia (BADASS emphasis!), and could even have been added later. It doubles his stats, but in a throwaway and almost meaningless manner, and these deaths are sometimes left off lists of deaths in the Iliad. Kudos to Max Ehrenfreund for the request.
Here’s a clickable link to Ian Johnston’s work on the Iliad: a lovely translation that’s perfect for first-time readers, a list of the speeches (invaluable to students), and of course the list of deaths which formed the basis of this Infographic along with my own research.
 (He’s done the Odyssey too!)
This is one of the most epic infographics of all times. And it is not just because Iliad is one of my favorite books. This is particularly because I owned a very particular edition that was published in the beginning of the 90s, which contained a lot of images of fights that really helped me to immerse into the story. The book got lost when we moved, but I recently found it in one of the antique stores, and bought it for my kids. I will also show them this article and I’m sure they are gonna love it.

China's geopolitical ambitions focus on Southeast Asia, where Beijing is intent upon establishing a preeminent sphere of influence. Illinois senior Senator Dick Durbin said in 2008 that he received many constituent complaints about the dispute between Blagojevich and Madigan, with letter writers wanting him to step in to negotiate. Cuba cannot use its own merchant fleet for transporting these goods, but has to make use of vessels from third countries, primarily the United States. No further treatment of the thyroid is required, unless cancer is detected. He was denied admission because of race, and subsequently filed suit. He suggested to Upjohn that marketing alprazolam for panic disorder would both cover new diagnostic territory and emphasize the unique potency of this drug. The issue is been unnecessarily sensationalized by the newspaper media, further creating more confusion and chaos among the domestic pharma companies and patent practitioners, however, the whole dasatinib episode has surely left us with few questions that now need utmost attention. When a keratitis is unresponsive to treatment and associated with strong ocular pain, topical anesthetic abuse should be considered, and a history of psychiatric disorders and other substance abuse have been implicated as important factors in the diagnosis. However, the episode recharged CWS and its membership base and proved to be a catalyst for rejuvenation which is continuing today.

This robust revenue growth was primarily driven by the sales momentum for the Group's mobile offerings. € millions €438 million. The main factors that drove this performance were as follows: The Group maintained its sales momentum of previous quarters during the first three months of 2015 and was France's leading recruiter of mobile subscribers for the 13th quarter in a row, with 420,000 net adds. At March 31, 2015, the Group had 10,525,000 mobile subscribers, representing a market share of more than 15% 1 . The Group's excellent performance demonstrates its successful policy of constantly enriching its commercial offerings (e.g., subscribers can now have up to four Free Mobile Plans at €15.99 per month for each Freebox subscription). It also testifies to the success of our continuing efforts to develop 4G services (more than 950 new 4G sites deployed in first-quarter 2015 compared with 400 in the same year-ago period), integrate new roaming destinations (Canada, Belgium, etc.) into the Free Mobile Plan (available for €19.99 per month or €15.99 per month) and make the mobile phone offering more attractive. As a result of all these measures, the Group was able to further improve its subscriber mix within net adds during the period. reflecting the improved subscriber mix and migrations of subscribers from the entry-level €2 plan to the €19.99 per month Free Mobile Plan. €640 million.

On March 10, 2015, Free launched the new, ultra-compact Freebox mini 4K - the world's first 4K box running Android TV TM - available for an all-inclusive price of €29.99 per month. Innovation is the keyword in this new offering, with features such as a remote control with voice recognition, access to ultra-high definition images and Android TV TM applications.

-=-=-TEXT: (Adds company news items)
LONDON May 15 (Reuters) - European stocks were expected to be steady at the open on Friday, helped by signs that jitters in the bond market this week were starting to ease off.
Financial spreadbetters expected Britain's FTSE 100 to open between 1 point higher and 4 points lower, or flat in percentage terms. Germany's DAX was expected to open up between 5-10 points, or 0.1 percent higher, while France's CAC 40 was seen opening flat.
A pick-up this week in benchmark German and U.S. bond yields had made equities look more expensive compared with debt. Some investors trimmed equity positions to cash in on the earlier stock market rally.
But fears over the bond sell-off seemed to recede on Thursday as the rest of the broader European stock market also recovered, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index finishing 0.7 percent higher.
"The sell-off in bond markets does appear to be slowing following what was quite a dramatic decline in a very short period of time. This was especially surprising considering the European Central Bank is taking the other side of that trade which usually piles downward pressure on yields but it appears that in a low liquidity and highly anxious market, the central bank has met its max," said Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam. > GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares edge down but poised for weekly rise > US STOCKS-S&P 500 ends at record high as dollar loses ground > > TREASURIES-Yields fall as supply eases; German debt steadies > FOREX-Dollar still on the defensive after tough week, economic data eyed > PRECIOUS-Gold near 3-mth high; eyes weekly gain on U.S. rate expectations > METALS-London copper set to close flat for second week > Oil heads for weekly gain, shrugs off ample supply; US output eyed

-=-=-TEXT: Sprint isn't the only company hoping to shell out billions for the privilege of scooping up T-Mobile's US branch; according to the Wall Street Journal, a French company called Iliad wants in on the action as well. Iliad, which owns a mobile operator in France known as Free, recently made a bid to counter the reported $32 billion offer T-Mobile is already entertaining with Sprint's parent company Softbank. The terms of the deal are unknown, and it's unclear how Iliad can pay for such a transaction, since its market value of $16 billion is merely half of what Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son is putting on the table.
Iliad's point of view is that its offer will be looked upon more favorably by regulators than a potential merger between Sprint and T-Mobile. If its bid is successful, the company plans to take control of the carrier, which means there would still be four major national players in the US. Since competition is one of the biggest concerns to the Powers That Be, Iliad believes its offer would stand a much better chance of clearing the necessary legal hurdles. And if the company were to use the same strategy with T-Mobile as it does with Free, it's likely the UnCarrier moves would not only continue but get even more aggressive in pricing. It's hard to say at this point if T-Mobile and parent company Deutsche Telekom will entertain Iliad's offer, but at least the situation just became a whole lot more intriguing.

-=-=-TITLE: Interview – Santiago Falbo and the Argentine DNA
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: Interview – Santiago Falbo and the Argentine DNA May 15th, 2015 Tweet 
In one of his last articles, the journalist John Carlin attempted to uncover why the success of the Argentine players in the world of football. In the opinion of the British, Argentines have a unique virtue which is essential for success in any aspect of life: they feel at home anywhere. 
Unlike other Latin American expatriates who prefer to live in the “barrios” of North America or Europe, the Argentine walks the streets of Auckland, Dublin or New York as if they were an extension of the arrogant and charming Buenos Aires. 
The author – born and raised in Argentina – subscribes to the reasoning of Carlin. Argentine citizens are arrogant enough to believe that the avenue “Nueve de Julio” is actually the continuation of Les Champs-Elysees. 
We are as noisy as the Brazilians, not with joy, but with a thirst for revenge. We believe that everyone fucked us. We walk with the arrogance of someone who knows they are in inferior conditions but, in order to scare the giants, breaks everything he has in his wake. We are a sort of Achilles who recite in every corner of the world his own Iliad. We want to be the best in all aspects and we want the whole world to know it. 
It is no wonder then that the various clubs in the world engage players of that nationality in order to strengthen their squads. In every league in the world, from the most important to the most unknown, there is always an Argentine player standing out. 
Santiago Falbo is one of those Argentines who has played his football in different stadiums around the globe. Professionally born in Defensa and Justicia, Falbo has played at various clubs in Italy, Belgium and Ireland. 
At present, the central midfielder plays in New Zealand with Waitakere United, one of the most important teams in the country. 
In this exclusive interview with Back Page Football, Falbo takes stock of his first season in the land of the All Blacks and remember his time at League of Ireland side Bohemians. 
Your career as a footballer has taken you to a number of different countries and now you find yourself playing with Waitakere United of New Zealand. How did you get there? Was it difficult to make the decision to go play there? 
I got there through contacts with the manager of the club, the Irishman Brian Shelley. I have a past as a player of Bohemian FC, the same club where he had played. That made the arrival easier. It was not a difficult decision, it was a new experience for me. In each country and in each league you can always learn new things. 
How is the New Zealand football? Is there a style or is it similar to English football? 
There isn’t a particular style of play in New Zealand. There is, however, a feature that is a given here – almost all teams play tactically 4-3-3. 
For an Argentine player, the passion of the fans is important. How is football is lived there? Is it something important to people? 
Yes, it’s a big change. Both in football and in life itself everything is much calmer, and that fascinates me. Still, everything changes for me when it comes to playing football. 

When the team loses a match I suffer a lot more than my peers, that’s for sure. Here, perhaps, some take it as a defeat and nothing else, but for me it is the worst. 
Waitakere and Auckland City are the biggest teams in the league, between them they have won every league championships in the last ten years. But internationally, the Auckland has won the OFC Champions League in the last five editions. What do you consider to be their secret for such a domain? 
Clearly, these two are the most important teams in the country but in recent years Auckland City was a little above us and could dominate either the local league and the OFC Champions League. 

Their great secret, I think, is the order that runs in the club. They also have a great manager – the Spaniard Ramon Tribulietx. 
The season is over. How do you evaluate your first year here? How do you see the future of the team? 
Personally it was a good year. While I played a few games during the first rounds, at the end of the season I earned a spot in the starting line-up, which was my main objective. 

Losing the semi-final against the Auckland left a bitter taste, but if we analyse thoroughly my first year, it was very positive. I think if the club keeps the same squad and the same coaching staff, we can put up a fight to Auckland City. 
Your career led you to play for a while in Ireland, more precisely with Bohemians Football Club. How do you assess your time at Ireland? 
My time in Ireland was short, I played a few games. I was not easy for me to adapt at first but, when I was reaching a good level, there was a change of manager at the club, which did not benefit my situation. 

As I said before, every new country or league has given me some a valuable experience. Bohemians fans write to me today, knowing I deserved more opportunities and I feel that, when I got to be part of the starting line up, I played at a good level. So I feel I could have given more to the club. 
The ASB Premiership is a semi-professional tournament. Do you complement your football career with another job? 
True, it is a semi professional tournament, but you can live, economically speaking, as a football player. Also, I’m working as a coach in youth divisions, which is something that I love. It’s something I do in my spare time. It is a job that helps me to be trained as a professional, but also means extra cash income. 
How is your life in New Zealand? What did you do to adapt quickly to New Zealander society? 
When you come to a club and have good relations with your colleagues, you are already adapted to the city. They helped me in everything I needed. 

Luckily my English has improved since my stay in Ireland and that helped a lot. The society is very respectful and quiet, so there is no problem. It is also a very safe country, which makes you lead a quiet life. 
How is the life of an Argentine footballer who decides to become a globetrotter? Is it easy being uprooted or does it sometimes become difficult being away from home? 
It’s not easy at all. I was leaving things along the way – family, friends, girlfriend – to realise the dream I had since childhood. At the end of my career I will analyse if it was worth it or not but, as I always say, it would have been worse had I not tried to realise my dream. 

Today, technology makes communication much easier and I can be aware of everything that happens there in Argentina. 
What do you think for the future? Do you want to stay in New Zealand or are looking for a new challenge? 
I used to think too much about what will happen in the future. Now I enjoy the moment. Today I am doing very well in New Zealand but it is true that, in football, you never know. 

June approaches (and the opening of the transfer window) and there are always new offers. At that time I will have to evaluate what may be best for my career. 
How do you evaluate your career as a footballer? 
I am grateful, I was lucky to play in five different countries and meet incredible places. I learned too much in all these years, especially languages. I could have made good decisions and some not so good but I really have no regrets. I’m happy with what I’ve been doing. 
Finally, what is football for you? 
It is very difficult to answer because it is not just a sport. Those who know me know that football is everything to me, it’s my life. I have left many things behind to dream or plan to be related to football all my life. Author Info Juan D'Angelo Amateur football journalist, currently pursuing a degree in History at the National University of La PLata (Argentina).

Essays on  the Iliad 
Book 24: Achilles  and Priam  
 [August 11, 2000] 
This translation aims to provide an accurate text  of The Iliad in a modern English poetic idiom.  It is  designed, first and foremost, for those who are reading Homer's poem for the  first time.  I welcome any suggestions for improvements in the accuracy  and fluency.
This text uses the traditional Latinate spellings  and common English equivalents for the Greek names, e.g., Achilles,  Clytaemnestra, Achaeans, Menelaus, Hecuba, rather than modern renditions which  strive to stay more closely to the Greek: Akhilleus, Klytaimnestra, Akhaians, Menelaos, Hekabe, and so on,  with the exception of a very few names of gods—Cronos,  Ouranos—and a few others (e.g., Idaios).   And where there is a common English rendition of the name (e.g., Ajax, Troy, Teucer), I have used that.  A dieresis over a  vowel indicates that it is pronounced by itself (e.g., Coön rhymes  with “go on” not with “goon,” Deïphobus is pronounced  “Day-ee-phobus” not “Day-phobus” or “Dee-phobus”).
If you would like the entire text of the Iliad sent  to you in a single Word file, please contact Ian Johnston. A pdf version of this complete translation is  available here.

PARIS (Reuters) - L'opérateur télécoms Iliad a fait état vendredi d'une hausse de 7,0% de son chiffre d'affaires au premier trimestre, la poursuite de conquêtes de nouveaux clients dans le mobile ayant contrebalancé la forte compétition dans le fixe. 
La maison-mère de Free, qui a confirmé anticiper une hausse supérieure à 10% de son résultat d'exploitation (Ebitda) cette année, a recruté 420.000 nouveaux abonnés mobiles sur la période, s'arrogeant au total plus de 15% du marché. 
Dans le fixe, l'opérateur a séduit 77.000 nouveaux clients mais son revenu moyen par client a reculé pour s'établir à 34,70 euros contre 35,10 euros au 31 décembre 2014. 
Le titre a clôturé jeudi soir en hausse de 0,16% à 216,95 euros, donnant une capitalisation boursière de 12,7 milliards d'euros. Depuis le début de l'année, il affiche une hausse de 9%.

-=-=-TEXT: While it’s not clear if T-Mobile’s owner Deutsche Telekom is taking seriously a $15 billion bid from French telecommunications firm Iliad, one thing is certain: The deal would be a lot easier to get approved than any merger with Sprint.
The difficulty in getting a deal approved for Iliad over Sprint is akin to the difference between heating a Hot Pocket and making a soufflé.
Antitrust regulators wouldn’t likely have many issues with an Iliad deal since the French company doesn’t have any U.S. telecom assets and its purchase of T-Mobile wouldn’t consolidate the industry by lowering the number of large wireless carriers from four to three.
The Federal Communications Commission would consider whether the deal is in the public interest as well as ensuring it falls within foreign ownership limits.
The foreign ownership issue likely wouldn’t really be much of an sticking point, however, since T-Mobile’s current majority owner is German telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom. Transferring ownership to a French company wouldn’t really be a big deal — unlike, say, an acquisition by a Chinese or Russian company with government ties.
“Unless we’re worried about an invasion from France I don’t think this would be held up on foreign ownership issues,” said Paul Gallant, a telecommunications analyst at Guggenheim Securities.
“Sprint/T-Mobile raises classic antitrust red flags,” he continued. “Iliad raises none and their history of disruption in France would probably be viewed positively by regulators.”
Regulators have been unusually public about their concerns of Sprint buying T-Mobile and further consolidating the U.S. wireless market. Three years ago, the Justice Department and FCC effectively killed AT&T’s attempt to acquire T-Mobile over worries that the deal would decrease wireless competition.
The widespread belief that a Sprint/T-Mobile merger would be a hard sell in Washington is reportedly why it’s taking so long for Sprint’s owner SoftBank to nail down a deal. The company needs to come up with enough incentives for regulators to see the deal as more positive than negative and it’s not clear yet whether SoftBank can clear that hurdle.
“We still believe a [Sprint/T-Mobile] merger is overwhelmingly likely to be blocked,” telecom analyst Craig Moffett said this week in a research note.
One analyst predicted that the longer T-Mobile awaits to strike a deal, the more likely it is to attract other potential suitors (and perhaps a richer price than the $40 a share Sprint reportedly is talking).
“While the delays in announcing a Sprint-T-Mobile deal are often explained away as preparing for regulators, we question whether Deutsche Telekom is on board with the deal — and frankly Sprint is somewhat to blame for this,” wrote BTIG research analyst Walter Piecyk in a note Friday.

(Boursier.com) — Iliad a démarré le millésime 2015 sur un chiffre d'affaires en hausse de 7% et des recrutements en progression, même si le rythme de hausse dans le fixe est faible dans un marché mature. 
Le groupe a amélioré de 7% son chiffre d'affaires du premier trimestre, pour le porter à 1,074 milliard d'euros. Le mobile (+18,5% à 437,9 ME) tire toujours la croissance, tandis que le fixe stagne (639,7 ME, +0,3%). L'opérateur revendique 10,525 millions d'abonnés mobiles (+4,1% en trois mois) et 5,945 millions d'abonnés fixes (+1,3% en trois mois). 
42% des recrutements haut débit du trimestre 
Dans le mobile, la part de marché dépasse 15%, selon une estimation interne, et l'opérateur se targue d'être le principal recruteur d'abonnés en France pour le 13ème mois consécutif. En haut débit, les recrutements nets ont atteint 77.000 clients sur le trimestre, soit 42% du marché. L'arrivée de nouveaux abonnés a été dopée par la réalisation d'une "vente privée" en début d'année, ce qui a aussi à l'inverse pesé sur le revenu moyen par abonné puisque l'ARPU a baissé à 34,70 euros par abonné fin mars, contre 35,10 euros fin décembre et 35,50 euros fin septembre. Sur l'offre Freebox Revolution, l'ARPU reste supérieur à 38 euros. La migration des abonnés vers le VDSL2 et le FTTH continue, et Free revendique plus de 700.000 abonnés pouvant bénéficier de plus de 30 Mbits/s de débit, soit environ 11,8% du parc. 
L'opérateur confirme viser une croissance de son EBITDA supérieure à 10%. Anthony Bondain —©2015, Boursier.com

-=-=-TEXT: (Adds futures prices, company news items)
LONDON May 15 (Reuters) - European equity index futures advanced on Friday, helped by signs that jitters in the bond market this week were starting to ease off.
The futures indexes for the euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50, Germany's DAX and France's CAC were all up by around 0.3 percent at 0620 GMT.
A pick-up this week in benchmark German and U.S. bond yields had made equities look more expensive compared with debt. Some investors trimmed equity positions to cash in on the earlier stock market rally.
But fears over the bond sell-off seemed to recede on Thursday as the rest of the broader European stock market also recovered, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index finishing 0.7 percent higher.
"The sell-off in bond markets does appear to be slowing following what was quite a dramatic decline in a very short period of time. This was especially surprising considering the European Central Bank is taking the other side of that trade which usually piles downward pressure on yields but it appears that in a low liquidity and highly anxious market, the central bank has met its max," said Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam. > GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares edge down but poised for weekly rise > US STOCKS-S&P 500 ends at record high as dollar loses ground > > TREASURIES-Yields fall as supply eases; German debt steadies > FOREX-Dollar still on the defensive after tough week, economic data eyed > PRECIOUS-Gold near 3-mth high; eyes weekly gain on U.S. rate expectations > METALS-London copper set to close flat for second week > Oil heads for weekly gain, shrugs off ample supply; US output eyed
COMPANY NEWS:
AIRBUS :
India's defence procurement agency has cleared the purchase of 56 transport planes from Europe's Airbus in collaboration with local partner Tata Sons in a deal worth an estimated $1.9 billion, a defence ministry source said on Thursday. Separately, Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported that Germany's defence ministry has decided to buy MEADS, the successor to the Patriot missile defence system from MBDA, a joint venture of Airbus, BAE Systems and Finmeccanica.
ALLIANZ :
Pimco's global equities Chief Investment Officer Virginie Maisonneuve is leaving the bond powerhouse, it said on Thursday, less than a year and a half after she was hired.
BANKS:
Banks want assurances from U.S. regulators that they will not be barred from certain businesses before agreeing to plead guilty to criminal charges over the manipulation of foreign exchange rates, causing a delay in multi-billion-dollar settlements, people familiar with the matter said.
In an unprecedented move, the parent companies or main banking units of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Barclays Plc and UBS Group AG are likely to plead guilty to rigging foreign exchange rates to benefit their transactions.
CARREFOUR /CASINO :
France's Competition Authority is investigating a proposed alliance between Auchan and Systeme U, two French supermarket chains, after Brussels regulators referred it for review, according to Le Figaro newspaper. The two, which compete with larger companies Carrefour and Casino, had planned to combine their purchasing platforms and put in place broader co-operation that stops short of a complete merger.
DEUTSCHE POST :
German labour union Verdi has called on workers at Deutsche Post to continue walkouts on Friday ahead of a next round of negotiations scheduled for May 20 and 21.
ILIAD :
French telecoms group Iliad posted a rise in first-quarter sales as strong growth in its mobile business offset more intense competition for broadband customers.
NEW LOOK:
South African investment house Brait SE will pay $1 billion for a controlling stake in British fashion retailer New Look, it said on Friday.
SYNGENTA :
U.S. seeds giant Monsanto is trying to line up buyers for assets worth up to $8 billion to appease competition authorities before making a fresh takeover approach for Swiss Syngenta, possibly within three weeks, industry sources said.
UNICREDIT :
Italian bank UniCredit wants to "defend" its business in Ukraine despite political tensions in the country, the boss of its central and eastern European division said on Thursday.
WORLD DUTY FREE :
Italian airport retailer World Duty Free on Thursday raised its 2015 targets for revenues and core profit to reflect more favourable exchange rates, and said revenues in the first 18 weeks rose 23.5 percent to 789.6 million euros ($897 million). World Duty Free will be taken over by larger rival Dufry to create a travel retail heavyweight with a 25 percent market share. As part of the deal the Swiss group will launch a mandatory tender at 10.25 euros per share (Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta )

-=-=-TEXT: 1st - 2nd century AD Iliad Papyrus
The Iliad tells the story of the Trojan War and is, along with the Odyssey, one of the two major Greek epic poems traditionally attributed to Homer, a blind Ionian poet. Scholars dispute whether Homer existed, and whether he was one person, but they usually date the poems to the 9th or 8th century BC. They are the oldest literary documents in the Greek language.
Major characters
Menelaus, Paris, Diomedes, Odysseus, Nestor, Achilles and Agamemnon
As an epic, the Iliad contains a sometimes confusingly great number of characters. The latter half of the Iliad's second book (often called the Catalogue of Ships) is devoted entirely to listing the various commanders. Many of the battle scenes in the Iliad feature bit characters who are quickly slain. See Trojan War for a detailed list of participating armies and warriors.
The main protagonist is the Greek hero Achilles, leader of the Myrmidones, and his rival is Hector, prince of Troy.
Patroclus, friend or lover to Achilles whose death unleashes Achilles' wrath on Hector.
Agamemnon, the supreme commander of the Greek armies.
Paris, Trojan prince and brother to Hector.
Diomedes and Odysseus, Greek heroes
Greek deities, such as Zeus, Aphrodite and Athena appear predominantly in the Iliad as manipulators of the humans.
The story of the Iliad
Spoiler warning: Plot or ending details follow.
The Iliad narrates several weeks of action during the tenth and final year of the Trojan War, concentrating on the wrath of Achilles. It begins with the dispute between Achilles and Agamemnon, and ends with the funeral rites of Hector. Neither the background and early years of the war (Paris' abduction of Helen from King Menelaus), nor its end (the death of Achilles & the Trojan Horse), are directly narrated in the Iliad. The Iliad and the Odyssey are part of a larger cycle of epic poems of varying lengths and authors; only fragments survive of the other poems, however.
Many Greek myths exist in multiple versions, so Homer had some freedom to choose among them to suit his story. What follows are the most common background details to the Trojan War, including (parenthetically) whether or not Homer specifically mentions them. See Greek mythology for more detail.
Background to the Iliad: The Trojan War
Both the gods Zeus and Poseidon desired the sea-nymph Thetis, but a prophecy made by Prometheus revealed that Thetis's son would be greater than his father. Owing to this reason, both gods resisted Thetis and betrothed her to a mortal king, Peleus, so that her offspring would be no more than human. To Peleus and Thetis a son was born, named Achilles. Hoping to protect him, when he was an infant his mother dipped him in the river Styx, making him invincible everywhere except the heel (the legendary Achilles' heel) by which she held him. Achilles would grow up to be the greatest of all mortal warriors.
All of the gods were invited to Peleus' and Thetis' wedding, except Eris, or Discord. Insulted, she attended invisibly and cast down upon the table a golden apple on which were inscribed the words To the fairest. The apple was disputed over by Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. None of the gods would venture an opinion favouring any one contender for fear of earning the enmity of the other two. Eventually, Zeus ordered the matter to be settled by Paris, the youngest prince of Troy, who was being raised as a shepherd in the plains nearby. Athena tempted Paris with wisdom, Hera offered him power, and Aphrodite offered him the most beautiful woman in the world. Paris eventually awarded the apple to Aphrodite.
The most beautiful woman in the world was Helen, daughter of Leda by Zeus. Scores of men sought her hand. Her father was unwilling to choose any for fear the others would attack him; finally, at Odysseus' suggestion, he solved the problem by making all the suitors swear an oath to protect Helen and her future husband. These suitors included Agamemnon, Ajax the Greater, Ajax the Lesser, Diomedes, Odysseus, Nestor, Idomeneus, and Philoctetes. Helen married Menelaus of Sparta; her sister Clytemnestra married his brother Agamemnon of Thebes. (See House of Atreus).
On a diplomatic mission to Sparta, Paris became enamoured of Helen, and she either eloped with or was abducted back to Troy by Paris. In anger, Menelaus called upon Helen's past suitors to make good their oaths to attack Troy. Eventually an army of a thousand ships marshalled by Menelaus' brother Agamemnon was gathered at Aulis, including all the above-named men and their own forces. A seer told them that the winds would not take them to Troy unless Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter Iphigenia. He did so, and the fleet set off. They landed at Troy, eventually, where there ensued a siege of nine years, broken only intermittently by fighting until the tenth year.
Shortly prior to the Iliad, Greek forces had raided a nearby town allied to Troy. Agamemnon had taken prisoner a girl, Chryseis, daughter of a local priest of Apollo. The priest begged the god to punish the Greeks, and a plague ravaged their army.
Iliad's story
Overview
The Iliad focuses mainly on Achilles and his rage against king Agamemnon, the Greek commander-in-chief, who has taken an attractive slave and spoil of war Briseis from Achilles. Achilles, the greatest warrior of the age, follows the advice of his mother and withdraws from battle in revenge and the allied Achaean (Greek) armies nearly lose the war.
In counterpoint to Achilles' pride and arrogance stands the Trojan prince Hector, son of the King Priam, with a wife and child, who fights to defend his city and his family. The death of Patroclus, Achilles' dearest friend or lover, at the hands of Hector, brings Achilles back to the war for revenge, and he slays Hector. Later Hector's father, king Priam, comes to Achilles disguised as a beggar to ransom his son's body back, and Achilles is moved to pity; the funeral of Hector ends the poem.
The poem is a poignant depiction of the tragedy and poignancy of friendship and family destroyed by battle. The first word of the Greek poem is "Μηνιν" ("mēnin", meaning "wrath"); the main subject of the poem is the wrath of Achilles; the second word is "aeide", meaning "sing"; the poet is asking someone to sing; the third word is "thea", meaning "goddess"; the goddess here being the "Mousa" or "muse"; a literal translation of the first line would read "Wrath, sing goddess, of Peleus' son Achilles" or more intelligibly "Sing, goddess, the wrath of Peleus' son Achilles". (Il.1.1 (http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Hom.+Il.+1.1) at PP)
Post Iliad: Conclusion of the war, and after
Although certain events subsequent to the funeral of Hector are foreshadowed in the Iliad, and there is a general sense that the Trojans are doomed, a detailed account of the fall of Troy is not set out by Homer. The following account comes from later Greek and Roman poetry and drama.
Achilles was killed on the battlefield by Paris, with a poisoned arrow to his vulnerable heel. (See Achilles' Heel.) Ajax the Greater and Odysseus feuded over who would keep his armour. They drew lots and Odysseus won. Ajax went mad with grief and slaughtered his livestock, believing they were the Greek commanders. Overcome with grief, he then killed himself. The Amazons came to join the battle. Philoctetes, a crippled Greek who had been abandoned by the others along the journey, was recruited because the war could not, it was prophesied, be won without his bow.
Odysseus devised a plan to take the city. He had his men build a large, hollow wooden horse, then he and twenty others hid inside. The Greek ships withdrew out of sight of Troy, admitting defeat, and left behind them only the horse, purportedly as an offering to Poseidon for good winds on the return trip. The Trojans took this inside the city, and then feasted and celebrated in the belief the war was over. At night the soldiers crept out and opened the gates to the other Greeks who had sailed back under cover of night. The city was sacked, and in some accounts burned for seven years. Priam was killed. According to one tradition, Hector's wife Andromache threw his son Astyanax and herself from the ramparts to save them from slavery. According to another, Astyanax was killed by Neoptolemus, son of Achilles, to ensure that Hector's son could not seek vengeance for his father's death against Achilles' son. Andromache became Neoptolemus' concubine, later to marry Helenus, Hector's brother. A Roman tradition held that Aeneas escaped with his family and several hundred people, who after years of migration eventually founded Rome. (This was used by Virgil in his Aeneid.)
Odysseus' long journey home is narrated in Homer's Odyssey. Menelaus and Helen returned to Sparta to rule. Agamemnon took home as a slave the priestess Cassandra, who was gifted with prophecy but cursed never to be believed. When he returned home he was murdered by his wife Clytemnestra and her lover, Aegisthus. They in turn were killed by Agamemnon's son, Orestes, and his daughter, Elektra.
Homosexuality and themes in the Iliad
The main theme of the poem is the story of how Achilles moves from being filled with anger, because of being publicly humiliated by Agamemnon to becoming more human. The poem also deals with issues such as whether honor and glory or long life are higher goods, the simultaneous glorification and vilifaction of war, and whether love can help make a person more human.
The closest word the ancient Greeks had for “homosexual” was “paiderastia” meaning “boy love”. It was a relationship between an older male and a young man around fourteen to twenty. The older man was called “erastes”, he was to educate, protect, love, and provide a role model for his lover. His lover was called “eromenos” whose reward for his lover lay in his beauty, youth, and promise.
With the Iliad the ancient Greeks had trouble designating which role to assign to Patroclus and Achilles. Aeschylus in the tragedy Myrmidons made Achilles the protector since he had avenged his love’s death even though the gods told him it would cost his own life. However Phaedrus asserts that Homer emphasized the beauty of Achilles which would qualify him not Patroclus as “eromenos”.
Plato wrote the Symposium about 385 BC, and by then an established tradition viewed Achilles and Patroclus lovers. However there was still debate on whether this was Homer’s intentions or misguided. Aeschylus who wrote a century earlier in his popular tragedy Myrmidons regarded the relationship sexual and stated it in explicit detail. He tells of Achilles visiting Patroclus’ dead body and criticizing him for letting himself be killed. In it Achilles speaks of a “devout union of the thighs”. This reading was the common view at the climax of the Hellenistic era, though it was not shared by all.
Evidence of this debate is found in a speech by an Athenian politician Aeschines at his trial in 345 BC. Aeschines in placing an emphasis on the importance of pederasty to the Greeks argues that though Homer does not state it explicitly educated people should be able to read between the lines. “Although (Homer) speaks in many places of Patroclus and Achilles, he hides their love and avoids giving a name to their friendship, thinking that the exceeding greatness of their affection is manifest to such of his hearers as are educated men.” Most ancient writers followed the thinking laid out by Aeschines.
The inquiry is of significant importance. Homer’s Iliad is the most important sources for Greek history prior to 600 BC when Greek literary texts became numerous. In it he does not use the terms “erastes” and “eromenos”, it has been argued that their relationship was not pederastic but rather egalitarian. In his Ionian culture it appears homosexuality had not taken on the form it later would in pederasty. However some scholars such as Bernard Sergent have argued that it had though it was not reflected in Homer. He asserts that ritualized man-boy relations were widely diffused through Europe from prehistoric times.
It is impossible to designate the roles found in the Iliad between Achilles and Patroclus along pederastic lines. Achilles is the most dominant. Among the warriors in the Trojan War he has the most fame. Patroclus performs duties such as cooking, and nursing yet is older than Achilles. Both also sleep with women.
Nonetheless the emotion between the two is obviously intense love. Achilles is tender to Patroclus contrasted to his arrogance to others. Typically warriors fought for personal fame or their city-state. But Achilles emphasizes his relationship with Patroclus above all else. He dreams that all Greeks would die so that he and Patroclus might gain the fame of conquering Troy alone. After Patroclus dies he agonizes touching his dead body, smearing himself with ash, and fasting. It was not until his desire for revenge to kill Hector who had killed Patroclus that he would fight again; fully aware that the gods warned him it would cost his life.
Attempts to edit the text were undertaken by Aritarchus of Samothrace in Alexandria around 200 BC. He has been called “the founder of scientific scholarship”. In his belief he thought that Homer did not intend the two to be lovers. However he did agree that the “we-two alone” passage did imply a love relation and argued it was a later interpolation. But the majority of ancient and modern historians have accepted the lines to be an original part. Therefore even a Greek who argued against such a view had to admit that these lines expressed a relationship.
Technical features and translations
The poem is written in dactylic hexameter. The Iliad comprises roughly 16,000 lines of verse. Later Greeks divided it into twenty-four books, and this convention has lasted to the present day with little change.
The Iliad has been translated into English for centuries. George Chapman did a translation which John Keats praised in his sonnet, On First Looking into Chapman's Homer and Alexander Pope did another one in rhymed pentameters.
There are four widely read modern English translations. Richmond Lattimore provides a translation that reproduces, line for line, the rhythm of the original poem. Robert Fagles emphasizes contemporary English phrasing while maintaining faithfulness to the Greek. The translations of Stanley Lombardo and Robert Fitzgerald are known for their attention to Homer's imagery. Lombardo's translation is generally the one most often recommended by classics scholars because of its faithfulness to the Greek and its modern vernacular style. It has become the translation English language readers are most likely to finish.
Oxyrhynchus Papyrus, Iliad
The Iliad in antiquity
The Iliad and the Odyssey were considered by Greeks of the classical age and after as the most important works in Ancient Greek literature, and were the basis of Greek pedagogy in antiquity. As the center of the rhapsode's repertoire, their recitation was a central part of Greek religious festivals.
The Iliad in subsequent arts and literature
Subjects from the Trojan War were a favourite among ancient Greek dramatists. Aeschylus' trilogy Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides follow the story of Agamemnon following his return from the war.
A loose film adaptation of the Iliad, Troy, was released in 2004, starring Brad Pitt as Achilles and Eric Bana as Hector, and directed by German-born Wolfgang Petersen. Despite its popularity -- largely a result of a huge marketing campaign by the studio -- the film was a critical flop. Several critics voted it the worst film of 2004. In addition, it only loosely resembles the Homeric version.
A epic science fiction adaptation / tribute by acclaimed author Dan Simmons titled Illium was released in 2003. 'The novel received a Locus Award for best science fiction novel of 2003.
David Drake wrote the short story "The Warrior," with a character named Slick Des Grieux based on Achilles.

-=-=-TEXT: European Factors to Watch-Equity futures edge up as bond jitters ease off 
(Adds futures prices, company news items) 
LONDON May 15 (Reuters) - European equity index futures advanced on Friday, helped by signs that jitters in the bond market this week were starting to ease off. 
The futures indexes for the euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50, Germany's DAX and France's CAC were all up by around 0.3 percent at 0620 GMT. 
A pick-up this week in benchmark German and U.S. bond yields had made equities look more expensive compared with debt. Some investors trimmed equity positions to cash in on the earlier stock market rally. 
But fears over the bond sell-off seemed to recede on Thursday as the rest of the broader European stock market also recovered, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index finishing 0.7 percent higher. 
"The sell-off in bond markets does appear to be slowing following what was quite a dramatic decline in a very short period of time. This was especially surprising considering the European Central Bank is taking the other side of that trade which usually piles downward pressure on yields but it appears that in a low liquidity and highly anxious market, the central bank has met its max," said Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam. > GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares edge down but poised for weekly rise > US STOCKS-S&P 500 ends at record high as dollar loses ground >> TREASURIES-Yields fall as supply eases; German debt steadies > FOREX-Dollar still on the defensive after tough week, economic data eyed > PRECIOUS-Gold near 3-mth high; eyes weekly gain on U.S. rate expectations > METALS-London copper set to close flat for second week > Oil heads for weekly gain, shrugs off ample supply; US output eyed

Here is a new Loeb Classical Library edition of Homer’s stirring heroic account of the Trojan war and its passions. The eloquent and dramatic epic poem captures the terrible anger of Achilles, “the best of the Achaeans,” over a grave insult to his personal honor and relates its tragic result—a chain of consequences that proves devastating for the Greek forces besieging Troy, for noble Trojans, and for Achilles himself. The poet gives us compelling characterizations of his protagonists as well as a remarkable study of the heroic code in antiquity.
The works attributed to Homer include the two oldest and greatest European epic poems, the Odyssey and the Iliad. These have been published in the Loeb Classical Library for three quarters of a century, the Greek text facing a faithful and literate prose translation by A. T. Murray. William F. Wyatt now brings the Loeb’s Iliad up to date, with a rendering that retains Murray’s admirable style but is written for today’s readers.

-=-=-TITLE: Mobile operators plan to block online advertising
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: Several mobile operators plan to block advertising on their networks, setting the stage for a battle with digital media companies such as Google , AOL and Yahoo .
One European wireless carrier told the Financial Times that it has installed blocking software in its data centres and planned to turn it on before the end of 2015.
The software prevents most types of advertising from loading in web pages and apps, though it does not interfere with "in-feed" ads of the kind used by Facebook and Twitter .
The blocking technology was developed by Shine, an Israeli start-up whose shareholders include Horizon Ventures, the investment fund of Li Ka-shing, Asia's richest person.
Justin Sullivan | Getty Images Mr Li also controls Hutchison Whampoa , one of the world's largest telecoms groups.
"Tens of millions of mobile subscribers around the world will be opting in to ad blocking by the end of the year," said Roi Carthy, chief marketing officer of Shine. "If this scales, it could have a devastating impact on the online advertising industry."
Verizon , the largest US telecoms group, this week paid $4.4bn to buy AOL , seeking to gain a foothold in the rapidly growing market for advertising on mobile devices.
Marketers will spend almost $69 billion this year on mobile ads — more than triple the sum they spent two years ago — according to research group eMarketer.
Shine said it was working with a number of operators, including one with almost 40 million subscribers, though it declined to name them.
An executive at a European carrier confirmed that it and several of its peers are planning to start blocking adverts this year.
The executive said that the carrier will initially launch an advertising-free service for customers on an opt-in basis.
But it is also considering a more radical idea that it calls "the bomb", which would apply across its entire network of millions of subscribers at once. The idea is to specifically target Google, blocking advertising on its websites in an attempt to force the company into giving up a cut of its revenues.
What's working on mobile
Marketing software company HubSpot reported strong Q1 earnings. Its CEO Brian Halligan, discusses how the company is adapting to the changing mobile environment.
The Silicon Valley company is the world's largest advertising business, generating $60 billion a year from search, YouTube, and services such as Google Display Network and DoubleClick, which both deliver ads for third-party sites.
The executive at the mobile operator considering "the bomb" acknowledged that targeting Google could be risky from both a legal and public relations perspective. Under "net neutrality" rules in the European Union and the US, telecoms companies are forced to treat all data that flow through their networks equally.
But even within those markets, it would be feasible to block adverts on Google "just for an hour or a day" to bring the company to the negotiating table, the executive said.
More from the Financial Times:
Online arms race heats up over adverts
Screens collide in clash over advertising
Verizon looks to AOL for mobile ads edge
Many mobile operators are frustrated that digital media companies profit from their high-speed networks without having to invest in the infrastructure behind them. Such irritation was inflamed last month when Google launched Project Fi, its own wireless carrier in the US.
Google said it would be unreasonable for mobile operators to block ads, arguing that: "People pay for mobile internet packages so they can access the apps, video streaming, webmail and other services they love, many of which are funded by ads. Google and other web companies invest heavily in developing these services — and in the behind-the-scenes infrastructure to deliver them."
Blocking advertising on mobile networks is likely to provoke a fierce backlash from digital media companies. In 2013, Free, the French internet service provider owned by Iliad, blocked ads by default through its Freebox modem, causing huge controversy. It was forced to scrap the initiative within a week under pressure from the Socialist government.
Mr Carthy of Shine said that eliminating intrusive adverts is a "consumer right", even if it undermines the business model of online publishers that rely on advertising.
"Online advertising is out of control and it's polluting the user experience," he said. Pop-ups, auto-playing videos and other forms of digital advertising can consume between 10 and 50 per cent of a mobile subscriber's data plan, he added.
While ad-blocking is a new phenomenon on mobiles, it is more established on PCs and growing quickly. More than 140m people, or 5 per cent of the online population, use software such as Adblock Plus to eliminate adverts when browsing the web on laptops or desktop computers.
As the Financial Times reported in February, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have paid the makers of Adblock Plus to allow some ads on their sites to slip through its filters.
Google's relationship with ad-blocking is further complicated by the fact that such software is the most popular type of free add-on to Chrome, its popular web browser.

-=-=-TITLE: 
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: The fast growth of New York-based cloud provider DigitalOcean is making a French web hosting outfit jealous.
So Online.net, a subsidiary of French telecommunications company Iliad, plans to launch a simple but flexible new cloud service for developers to use for running applications — at an hourly price on par with DigitalOcean. The twist? It will run on dedicated servers that contain power-efficient ARM-based chips instead of the x86 chips used by most servers.
“What’s impressive with DigitalOcean is mainly their growth — that’s mainly why we looked at them,” Yann Léger, Online’s vice president of cloud computing, told VentureBeat in an interview. “They have incredible growth, and we would like to have the same growth as they do.”
But really, the bigger story is the route Online has chosen to arrive at that destination. The project, which has been in the works for two years and should be officially released in mid-January, could be one of the first attempts to shift cloud computing and even corporate computing from the dominant x86 chip architecture — available from Intel as well as other providers — to ARM.
See, the cloud infrastructure market has become highly competitive. Price cuts from one provider are followed up sometimes within a day by one or more competitors, and there’s a good deal of similarity in the service portfolios among the top providers. In attempting to catch up in the business of selling access to dedicated servers, Online is hitting the ARM button — and if the initiative proves successful, several others could begin or accelerate their own ARM programs.
What’s interesting with Online’s project, which is called Online Labs, is that Online has opted to build rather than buy, assembling its so-called C1 servers in house and relying on Marvell to produce the ARM-based chips.
The logical question is when, if ever, the major cloud providers specifically begin to implement servers based on ARM chips, which have become popular in mobile devices over the years.
Recent developments have suggested that work might be afoot at Amazon, for one, even if the models for the cost currently are “not quite there,” in the words of one executive who spoke with Bloomberg last month. Meanwhile, Microsoft has had a test version of its Windows Server operating system running on ARM-based servers, according to an October Bloomberg report.
Of course, other cloud providers could jump into the ARM-based public cloud market. Telcos like CenturyLink, Ericsson, NTT, and Verizon (which has said it would buy microservers from AMD’s SeaMicro) have made investments or acquisitions in order to bolster their own cloud portfolios and might well end up choosing ARM as a next step.
For now, though, Iliad will be an early mover in its efforts to power a cloud with ARM chips. That could bring advantages in terms of power consumption internally and, potentially, lower-cost cloud computing for customers.
The service, which currently has a 15-minute free trial, doesn’t depend on virtualization, whereby multiple virtual machines can run on a single physical server. That’s extremely unusual in the cloud world, where virtualization is the core technology that has allowed cloud service providers to serve many customers at once, and to rapidly increase or decrease the server resources allocated to those customers as needed. The Online servers therefore can be described as “bare metal.” And Online Labs won’t have all the elaborate features of a full-fledged public cloud like Amazon Web Services. Even so, Léger considers Online Labs — a provisional name, by the way — a cloud service by virtue of its hourly pricing model, the ability to change how much storage is allotted to a server, and the quick access to servers that it provides.
“It’s going to be a higher-level service than a dedicated server,” Léger said.
The standard C1 server has a four-core, 32-bit ARMv7 chip, with 2 GB of RAM and a 1 Gb network card, backed up by a 20 GB solid-state drive for storage, according to the Online Labs website. Eighteen of these small servers are stuck inside a blade server, and 16 of those blade servers can fit in a chassis within a cabinet. The hardware is running exclusively in an Online data center in Paris, with 4,000 people already using it, Léger said.
Online wants to bring its ARM-based servers to a U.S. data center in the first half of 2015, he said. His hope is that over time this service could be compelling to big businesses, and geographical availability is a real consideration for that sort of achievement.
The team behind Online’s initiative — about 20 people altogether — wants to make sure developers don’t have too much trouble deploying applications on the servers. They’ve been porting over Docker images of common application components, like the Debian operating system for the servers. And it helps that Oracle, for one, is helping matters by providing a Java development kit to run on ARM servers.
Large, mission-critical databases might not be the best fit for these puppies, but that doesn’t mean they won’t be useful for a wide range of applications. Applications for ARM-based Internet-connected devices on the Internet of things could benefit from a test environment, for example. And that’s not all.
“People working on Android also need this kind of environment to test, because it’s easier to test directly on ARM instead of [testing] on x86 and pushing your app to mobile devices,” Léger said.

-=-=-TEXT: La Bourse de Paris attendue sans grand changement au lendemain d'un rebond Paris, 15 mai 2015 (AFP) - Publié aujourd'hui à 08h32 - Réagir Bourse de Paris CC Fip /Wikimedia La Bourse de Paris devrait reprendre son souffle vendredi après avoir grimpé la veille, au démarrage d'une séance qui s'annonce calme en l'absence d'indicateurs macroéconomiques de premier plan. 
CAC 40 perdait 0,10% une quarantaine de minutes avant l'ouverture de la séance. 
La veille, le marché parisien est reparti de l'avant (+1,36%) après trois journées consécutives de repli, achevant au-dessus du seuil symbolique des 5.000 points une séance peu animée en raison d'un jour férié en France. 
De son côté, Wall Street a nettement monté jeudi, encouragée par un rebond du marché obligataire et des considérations techniques. 
Pour l'heure, « la consolidation est probable après les gains élevés de la veille », indique Stan Shamu, un stratégiste de IG. 
Le marché parisien a relevé la tête après plusieurs séances erratiques, déstabilisé notamment par les turbulences sur le marché obligataire de la dette souveraine, où les taux sont remontés en flèche après avoir atteint des records historiques à la baisse. 
Les investisseurs devraient toutefois se montrer rassurés sur les intentions de la Banque centrale européenne dans ce contexte, après avoir un temps redouté que l'institution de Francfort mette fin plus tôt que prévu à son vaste plan de soutien. 
Le président de la BCE Mario Draghi a salué jeudi l'efficacité de sa politique monétaire ultra-accommodante, répétant que ce programme d'assouplissement quantitatif qui vise à encourager la reprise en conservant des taux bas et à contrer les risques de déflation, serait appliqué « dans son entier ». 
Les marchés resteront par ailleurs attentifs aux divers indicateurs attendus outre-Atlantique, avec l'activité industrielle dans la région de New York en mai, la production industrielle d'avril et la première estimation de la confiance des consommateurs en mai par l'Université de Michigan. 
Les investisseurs sont toujours à l'affût d'indices pouvant leur permettre d'y voir plus clair sur le calendrier que pourrait adopter la banque centrale américaine (Fed) pour remonter ses taux directeurs. 
ors que la première estimation du PIB au premier trimestre est attendue. 
Le gouvernement grec, en quête urgente d'un accord avec ses créanciers pour toucher une tranche de prêts vitale, souhaite mettre cette question au menu d'un sommet européen prévu à Riga la semaine prochaine, normalement consacré à l'Europe orientale. Valeurs à suivre 
ILIAD, maison-mère de l'opérateur télécoms Free, a publié un chiffre d'affaires en hausse de 7% au premier trimestre à 1,075 milliard d'euros et dépassé la barre des 16 millions d'abonnés fixes et mobiles.

-=-=-TITLE: 
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT:  		In an interesting paper published in 1980, J.H. Phillips argued that the astronomical content of Homer's description of the Shield of Achilles at Iliad 18. 485-89, is essentially seasonal and, consequently, agricultural in its import ('The constellations on Achilles' shield (Iliad 18. 485-489)', LCM 5.8 (1980), pp. 179-80). According to his analysis, the Pleiades, the Hyades and Orion signify, through 'their sequential heliacal risings and subsequent cosmical settings', the period approximately from May to November. Within this time span, the major agricultural activities of harvesting, vintaging and ploughing would take place, as we know from the farmer's calendar in Hesiod's Works and Days. These same activities are then found in the ensuing description of other parts of the Shield at lines 541-72.
 		The problem with this explanation is the role of the last constellation enumerated by Homer - Arktos, the Bear. Unlike the other three star groups, the Bear is circumpolar, neither rising nor setting, but continually circling the north celestial pole (as line 489 makes clear). It is apparently, therefore, 'seasonless', as Phillips points out, and this character, he argues, suits the seasonless activities of lines 573-89, the herding of cattle and sheep, which go on all year.
 		What I would like to argue, however, is that there is possibly a sense in which the Bear is linked to the Pleiades, the Hyades and Orion, and which therefore makes its mention equally season-specific.
 		Preserved calendars like Hesiod's, or the later parapegmata from the late fifth century B.C. onwards, inure us to the idea that the first visible sighting of a star's rising, or the last visible sighting of its setting, at dawn or dusk, were the principal observed phenomena of the heavenly body's apparent movements. (1) But there is nevertheless early evidence of an awareness of a third significant position in the star's visible course across the sky: the transit, or culmination, when a star reaches the peak and mid-point of its course in the heavens, crossing the north-south meridian of the observer. Hesiod explicitly mentions the culmination of both Orion and Sirius at the time of Arcturus's (heliacal / dawn) rising at vintaging time:
 		For stars or constellations that rise and set, like Orion and Sirius, there can be only one visible transit across the meridian. But for a circumpolar star, two transits are observable, an upper and a lower one.
 		Let us take a closer look at the position of the stars in Iliad 18. 485-89, at the moments of heliacal (= dawn) rising and cosmical (= dusk) setting, for the Pleiades, the Hyades and Orion. In the first instance (heliacal rising), we find that the Bear (Ursa Major) lies directly north at its lower transit of the viewer's meridian, just skimming the northern horizon. Then, in the second instance (cosmical setting), we find it still directly north but at its upper transit across the meridian. In other words, as the Pleiades, the Hyades and Orion rise over the eastern horizon or sink into the western horizon, the Bear lies directly north at the bottom or at the peak of its circuit around the pole. (2)
 		No-one in the ancient literature, as far as I am aware, noted this coincidence of phenomena. So any deductions which can be derived from its discovery can be only hypothetical, made probable rather than true by the accumulation of other relevant observations. One such observation is to be drawn from noticing the nature of the agricultural activities which took place at the time of these stellar phenomena.
 		The time of the heliacal rising of the Pleiades, the Hyades and Orion, and of the lower transiting of the Bear, is also the time for summer harvesting (about May - June in our terms). And the time of the cosmical setting of the same constellations, and of the upper transiting of the Bear, is the time at the start of winter when the farmer should look to his ploughing and sowing (around November). It is here that we may see the appropriateness of the second name (Amaxa, Wagon) given to the Bear by Homer in what seems otherwise to be nothing more than a formulaic phrase. Amaxa is encountered in both Homer and Hesiod as a wagon or cart, which could be used in an agricultural context for transporting goods, such as seed to or harvest from the field - the very activities of which the Pleiades, the Hyades and Orion could remind a listener (cf. A.S.F. Gow, 'Hesiod's Wagon', JP 33 (1914), pp. 145-53; M.L. West (ed.), Hesiod, Works & Days (Oxford, 1978), p. 264 at line 424, and p. 273 at line 453).
 		Indeed, I would be tempted to go further than Phillips, and argue that the mention of these star groups by Homer could signify just two specific times of the agricultural year - about our November for ploughing and sowing, and our May / June for harvesting - rather than the whole period continuously from May to November. The period between May and November also includes the time of the grape harvest in September. But the timing of the vintage is indicated by Hesiod through a quite different set of stellar observations, as we have already noted: the culmination of Orion and Sirius, and the heliacal rising of Arcturus. (See H.A.T. Reiche, 'Fail-safe stellar dating: forgotten phases', TAPA 119 (1989), pp. 37-53, for a discussion of the usefulness of these star-sightings in a farmer's calendar of activities.)
 		Phillips' argument that the activities of herding cattle and sheep are 'seasonless', just as the circumpolar movement of Arktos renders it 'seasonless', is itself open to question. The archaeological evidence is potentially on his side, since integration of crop and livestock husbandry appears to be more likely for ancient Greece, than their separation by such practices as transhumance and bare fallowing. (P. Halstead, 'Traditional and ancient rural economy in Mediterranean Europe: plus a change?' JHS 107 (1987), pp. 81 and 83; M.W. Edwards, The Iliad: A Commentary, vol. V, books 17-20 (Cambridge, 1991), p. 212.) In other words, there is currently no archaeological evidence for seasonal movements of herds. But this is contradicted by literary evidence for such practices: the scholia on Iliad 18. 587- 88 state explicitly that herding of sheep is a springtime operation only. (3) On balance, one might argue that the argument from archaeology is the weaker, since new excavations or more sophisticated techniques of physical analysis could overturn the current position.
 		My argument strengthens the association between the four star groups in the Shield of Achilles, keeping them as a unit. At the same time, however, it undermines Phillips' case for a link between the constellations and all the agricultural activities on the Shield in the ensuing lines. Of those activities, only ploughing and harvesting would appear to be foreshadowed by the mention of the stars at Iliad 18. 485- 89.
 		 1. On parapegmata see G. Schiaparelli, Scritti sulla Storia della Astronomia Antica (Bologna, 1926), vol. I. 2, pp. 237 -85; O. Neugebauer, A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy (New York, 1975), vol. II, pp. 587 - 89 (with earlier bibliography); B.L. van der Waerden, Die Astronomie der Griechen: eine Einführung (Darmstadt, 1988), pp. 76 - 92.
 		 2. W. Leaf and M.A. Bayfield, The Iliad of Homer (London, 1901), vol. II, p. 455, suggested, 'In Northern Greece the Bear, when at its lowest, just touches the northern horizon; and this happens at the time when Orion is rising in the east. As the Bear at once begins to ascend, the idea arose that the great hunter has scared it from taking its bath.' I can find no evidence of this interpretation in the ancient literature, although the scholia on Iliad 488 display an awareness of the hunted - hunter relationship between the Bear and Orion (see H. Erbse, Scholia Graeca in Homeri Iliadem (Scholia Vetera) (Berlin, 1975), vol. IV, p. 532). Cf. F. Boll and W. Gundel, 'Sternbilder', in Ausfuehrliches Lexicon der griechischen und roemischen Mythologie ed. W.H. Roscher , vol. 6 (Leipzig, 1937), p. 987, where it is suggested that the constellation Orion must already have been given the character of a hunter for Homer's description of the Bear's look towards it to have any meaning.
 		 3. H. Erbse, Scholia Graeca in Homeri Iliadem (Scholia Vetera) (Berlin, 1975), vol. IV, p. 563. Oliver Taplin has said that since the preceding rural scenes 'clearly represent spring, summer, and autumn, I take it that 573ff. shows winter.' (O. Taplin, 'The Shield of Achilles within the Iliad', GR 27 (1980), pp. 7-8). But he perhaps ignores the possibility that we should be looking for five, rather than four, seasons, such as both Hesiod and the fifth century parapegmatist Euktemon are credited with having allowed for: see B.L. van der Waerden, Science Awakening (Leyden / New York, 1974) vol. II, p. 12; W.K. Pritchett and B.L. van der Waerden, 'Thucydidean Time-Reckoning and Euctemon's Seasonal Calendar', BCH 85 (1961), pp. 38-39.

(Boursier.com) — LA TENDANCE 
Après un début de semaine fort difficile, le CAC40 a repris des couleurs hier, pour repasser le cap des 5.000 points. Ce matin, les indicateurs avancés européens sont modérément optimistes. Cela sera-t-il suffisant pour afficher une performance hebdomadaire positive ? Pas sûr, car l'indice parisien aura à dépasser 5.090,39 points (clôture du vendredi précédent), ce qui nécessite une hausse de 1,21% minimum. 
Ce sont les indicateurs macroéconomiques américains qui devraient déterminer la teneur de la séance, avec notamment la production industrielle et la confiance des consommateurs. 
L'actualité des sociétés est un peu moins dense qu'en début de semaine mais il faut compter avec les trimestriels d' Iliad à Paris, ainsi qu'avec le probable canular d'une offre sur Avon Products , qui a fait flamber le titre de 20% hier, avant que les investisseurs n'aient des doute sur le mystérieux initiateur, PTG Capital Partners, inconnu au bataillon. La suite du feuilleton est attendue aujourd'hui mais il semble que le projet d'OPA soit effectivement farfelu. 
WALL STREET 
Après trois séances poussives, Wall Street a vivement rebondi jeudi, soutenu par la baisse du dollar ces derniers jours et par des chiffres de l'emploi hebdomadaire supérieurs aux attentes. Les cours des obligations ont entamé un rebond, permettant mécaniquement aux taux d'intérêts de se détendre. 
A la clôture, l'indice Dow Jones a gagné 1,06% à 18.252 points, tandis que le Nasdaq a bondi de 1,39% à 5.051 points. L'indice large S&P 500 a grimpé de 1,08% pour atteindre un nouveau record historique à 2.121 points. Son dernier record remontait au 24 avril dernier. 
ECO ET DEVISES 
Aux Etats-Unis, l'indice 'Empire State' d'activité manufacturière de la Fed de New York (14h30 : consensus 5) précèdera la production industrielle américaine d'avril (15h15 : consensus +0,0% m/m) et l'indice du sentiment des consommateurs américains de l'Université du Michigan et Reuters (16h00 : consensus 95,9). Aucune statistique d'envergure n'est programmée en Europe. 
La parité euro / dollar atteint 1,1409 ce matin. Le baril de Brent se négocie 66,63$ et le WTI 59,68$ pour l'échéance de juin. L'once d'or se traite 1.219$ (-0,11%). 
VALEURS A SUIVRE 
* EDF : la filiale belge Luminus veut faire son entrée en bourse. L'opération, prévue sur Euronext Bruxelles, pourrait avoir lieu d'ici la fin de l'année, si les conditions sont réunies, a indiqué l'entreprise actuellement détenue à 65,3% par l'énergéticien français. 
* Iliad : le groupe a démarré le millésime 2015 sur un chiffre d'affaires en hausse de 7% et des recrutements en progression, même si le rythme de hausse dans le fixe est faible dans un marché mature. L'opérateur confirme viser une croissance de son EBITDA supérieure à 10%. 
* SIPH , H2O Innovation , Compagnie Marocaine , Bone Therapeutics et Lexibook ont publié leurs comptes. Global Bioenergies renforce son management. Anthony Bondain —©2015, Boursier.com

-=-=-TEXT: adventuresofalgy : 
Algy had decided that it would be best to leave the final stage of production work on his book to his assistants. He reckoned that he had played his part, and now he deserved a rest :) So he perched on a rock by the water, and made plans for a wee spring adventure. He wanted to see the woodlands and flowers, the hills and the lochs, and all the colours of spring. 
As he sat there gazing at the clear water, he thought about the extraordinary process of writing books, and remembered a poem, which he dedicates to all his friends who have ever engaged in the strange business of writing: 
Cervantes was asleep when he wrote Don Quixote.Joyce slept during the Wandering Rocks section of Ulysses.Homer nodded and occasionally slept during the greater part of the Iliad; he was awake however when he wrote the Odyssey.Proust snored his way through The Captive, as have legions of his readers after him.Melville was asleep at the wheel for much of Moby-Dick.Fitzgerald slept through Tender Is the Night, which is perhaps not so surprising,but the fact that Mann slumbered on the very slopes of The Magic Mountain is quite extraordinary—that he wrote it, even more so. Kafka, of course, never slept, even while not writing or on bank holidays.No one knows too much about George Eliot’s writing habits—my guess is she would sleep a few minutes, wake up and write something, then pop back to sleep again.Lew Wallace’s forty winks came, incredibly, during the chariot race in Ben-Hur.Emily Dickinson slept on her cold, narrow bed in Amherst.When she awoke there would be a new poem inscribed by Jack Frost on the windowpane; outside, glass foliage chimed.Good old Walt snored as he wrote and, like so many of us, insisted he didn’t.Maugham snored on the Riviera.Agatha Christie slept daintily, as a woman sleeps, which is why her novels are like tea sandwiches—artistic, for the most part.I sleep when I cannot avoid it; my writing and sleeping are constantly improving. 
I have other things to say, but shall not detain you much.Never go out in a boat with an author—they cannot tell when they are over water.Birds make poor role models.A philosopher should be shown the door, but don’t, under any circumstances, try it.Slaves make good servants.Brushing the teeth may not always improve the appearance.Store clean rags in old pillow cases.Feed a dog only when he barks.Flush tea leaves down the toilet, coffee grounds down the sink.Beware of anonymous letters—you may have written them, in a wordless implosion of sleep. 
Algy was particularly tickled by the line “Birds make poor role models.” :) 
[Algy is quoting the poem Sleepers Awake by the contemporary American poet John Ashbery.] 72 notes

PARIS (Reuters) - L'opérateur télécoms Iliad a fait état vendredi d'une hausse de 7,0% de son chiffre d'affaires au premier trimestre, la conquête de nouveaux clients dans le mobile ayant contrebalancé la forte compétition dans le fixe. 
La maison-mère de Free, qui a confirmé anticiper une hausse supérieure à 10% de son résultat d'exploitation (Ebitda) cette année, s'est à nouveau imposée en début d'année comme le premier recruteur de nouveaux abonnés dans le mobile avec 420.000 clients supplémentaires. 
Trois ans après le lancement de ses offres à prix cassés qui ont déclenché une guerre des prix dans le secteur, le groupe de Xavier Niel s'est arrogé 15% du marché du mobile avec un total de 10,5 millions de clients. 
Son chiffre d'affaires dans le mobile a bondi de 18,5% au premier trimestre pour s'établir à 437,9 millions d'euros, contrebalançant la quasi-stagnation (+0,3%) de ses revenus dans le fixe. 
Au total, le chiffre d'affaires d'Iliad a progressé de 7,0% pour atteindre 1,07 milliard. 
Dans le fixe, nouveau front de la compétition ces derniers mois avec le lancement d'offres à prix bas par Bouygues Telecom (Bouygues), l'opérateur a encore séduit 77.000 nouveaux clients mais son revenu moyen par client a reculé pour s'établir à 34,70 euros contre 35,10 euros au 31 décembre 2014. 
La baisse s'explique pour partie par des opérations promotionnelles, notamment par le biais de ventes privées sur internet. 
Les analystes de Barclays tablaient sur un gain de 50.000 abonnés dans le fixe et de 375.000 dans le mobile. 
A titre de comparaison, Bouygues Telecom a recruté 96.000 clients supplémentaires dans le fixe sur la même période, s'imposant comme le premier recruteur de nouveaux abonnés sur ce segment. 
"On a toujours de très bonnes performances commerciales et on accélère nos investissements, notamment dans la 4G avec 1.000 antennes construites dans le trimestre", a déclaré à Reuters le directeur financier de la société, Thomas Reynaud. 
Selon le dernier décompte de l'agence nationale des fréquences, Free a dépassé le nouveau numéro deux français des télécoms Numericable-SFR en nombre d'antennes de très haut débit mobile "4G" mises en service. 
Le titre a clôturé jeudi soir en hausse de 0,16% à 216,95 euros, donnant une capitalisation boursière de 12,7 milliards d'euros. Depuis le début de l'année, il affiche une hausse de 9%.

(Adds futures prices, company news items) 
LONDON, May 15 (Reuters) - European equity index futures advanced on Friday, helped by signs that jitters in the bond market this week were starting to ease off. 
The futures indexes for the euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50, Germany's DAX and France's CAC were all up by around 0.3 percent at 0620 GMT. 
A pick-up this week in benchmark German and U.S. bond yields had made equities look more expensive compared with debt. Some investors trimmed equity positions to cash in on the earlier stock market rally. 
But fears over the bond sell-off seemed to recede on Thursday as the rest of the broader European stock market also recovered, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index finishing 0.7 percent higher. 
"The sell-off in bond markets does appear to be slowing following what was quite a dramatic decline in a very short period of time. This was especially surprising considering the European Central Bank is taking the other side of that trade which usually piles downward pressure on yields but it appears that in a low liquidity and highly anxious market, the central bank has met its max," said Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam. > GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares edge down but poised for weekly rise > US STOCKS-S&P 500 ends at record high as dollar loses ground > > TREASURIES-Yields fall as supply eases; German debt steadies > FOREX-Dollar still on the defensive after tough week, economic data eyed > PRECIOUS-Gold near 3-mth high; eyes weekly gain on U.S. rate expectations > METALS-London copper set to close flat for second week > Oil heads for weekly gain, shrugs off ample supply; US output eyed 
COMPANY NEWS: 
AIRBUS : 
India's defence procurement agency has cleared the purchase of 56 transport planes from Europe's Airbus in collaboration with local partner Tata Sons in a deal worth an estimated $1.9 billion, a defence ministry source said on Thursday. Separately, Sueddeutsche Zeitung reported that Germany's defence ministry has decided to buy MEADS, the successor to the Patriot missile defence system from MBDA, a joint venture of Airbus, BAE Systems and Finmeccanica. 
ALLIANZ : 
Pimco's global equities Chief Investment Officer Virginie Maisonneuve is leaving the bond powerhouse, it said on Thursday, less than a year and a half after she was hired. 
BANKS: 
Banks want assurances from U.S. regulators that they will not be barred from certain businesses before agreeing to plead guilty to criminal charges over the manipulation of foreign exchange rates, causing a delay in multi-billion-dollar settlements, people familiar with the matter said. 
In an unprecedented move, the parent companies or main banking units of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Barclays Plc and UBS Group AG are likely to plead guilty to rigging foreign exchange rates to benefit their transactions. 
CARREFOUR /CASINO : 
France's Competition Authority is investigating a proposed alliance between Auchan and Systeme U, two French supermarket chains, after Brussels regulators referred it for review, according to Le Figaro newspaper. The two, which compete with larger companies Carrefour and Casino, had planned to combine their purchasing platforms and put in place broader co-operation that stops short of a complete merger. 
DEUTSCHE POST : 
German labour union Verdi has called on workers at Deutsche Post to continue walkouts on Friday ahead of a next round of negotiations scheduled for May 20 and 21. 
ILIAD : 
French telecoms group Iliad posted a rise in first-quarter sales as strong growth in its mobile business offset more intense competition for broadband customers. 
NEW LOOK: 
South African investment house Brait SE will pay $1 billion for a controlling stake in British fashion retailer New Look, it said on Friday. 
SYNGENTA : 
U.S. seeds giant Monsanto is trying to line up buyers for assets worth up to $8 billion to appease competition authorities before making a fresh takeover approach for Swiss Syngenta, possibly within three weeks, industry sources said. 
UNICREDIT : 
Italian bank UniCredit wants to "defend" its business in Ukraine despite political tensions in the country, the boss of its central and eastern European division said on Thursday. 
WORLD DUTY FREE : 
Italian airport retailer World Duty Free on Thursday raised its 2015 targets for revenues and core profit to reflect more favourable exchange rates, and said revenues in the first 18 weeks rose 23.5 percent to 789.6 million euros ($897 million). World Duty Free will be taken over by larger rival Dufry to create a travel retail heavyweight with a 25 percent market share. As part of the deal the Swiss group will launch a mandatory tender at 10.25 euros per share (Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta) SEARCH

-=-=-TEXT: Tweet Bourse Paris: le CAC 40 dans le vert pour une séance calme (+0,17%) Paris (awp/afp) - La Bourse de Paris progressait timidement vendredi matin (+0,17%) au démarrage d'une séance qui sera essentiellement animée par la publication d'indicateurs aux Etats-Unis. A 09H20 (07H20 GMT), l'indice CAC 40 prenait 8,34 points à 5037,65 points. La veille, il avait progressé de 1,36%, rompant avec trois séances de baisse consécutives."Aujourd'hui, la matinée sera calme mais l'après-midi sera animée par plusieurs statistiques américaines", indique dans une note le courtier Aurel BGC. Au menu figurent notamment l'activité industrielle dans la région de New York en mai, la production industrielle d'avril et la première estimation de la confiance des consommateurs en mai par l'Université de Michigan."Les statistiques américaines de production industrielle et de confiance des consommateurs seront d'autant plus importantes aujourd'hui qu'elles feront suite à celle des ventes au détail qui se sont avérées décevantes", soulignent de leur côté les stratégistes de Crédit Mutuel-CIC."Elles conditionneront un éventuel rééquilibrage des attentes en termes de politique monétaire de la Fed", ajoutent-ils. Les investisseurs sont toujours à l'affût d'indices pouvant leur permettre d'y voir plus clair sur le calendrier que pourrait adopter la banque centrale américaine (Fed) pour remonter ses taux directeurs. Enfin, les préoccupations sur l'avancée des négociations entre la Grèce et ses créanciers restent en toile de fond, alors que la première estimation du PIB au premier trimestre est attendue. Le gouvernement grec, en quête urgente d'un accord avec ses créanciers pour toucher une tranche de prêts vitale, souhaite mettre cette question au menu d'un sommet européen prévu à Riga la semaine prochaine, normalement consacréà l'Europe orientale."Les tensions restent vives entre le gouvernement grec et les autorités européennes sans espoir de compromis à court terme", note Crédit Mutuel-CIC. Du côté des valeurs, Iliad grimpait de 1,20% à 219,55 EUR, profitant de la publication d'un chiffre d'affaires en hausse de 7% au premier trimestre à 1,075 milliard d'EUR. Le secteur bancaire contribuait à la bonne tenue du marché avec Société Générale (+0,67% à 45,23 EUR), BNP Paribas (+0,47% à 57,17 EUR) et Crédit Agricole (+0,31% à 14,36 EUR). Le secteur automobile, sensible à la conjoncture, était lui aussi bien orienté: Renault gagnait 0,94% à 92,17 EUR, Valeo 0,64% à 149,15 EUR et Peugeot 0,55% à 17,33 EUR. Les valeurs pétrolières et parapétrolières étaient quant à elles à la traîne, plombées par un repli des cours du brut. Total perdait 0,75% à 46,98 EUR, Technip 0,94% à 62,37 EUR, CGG 0,53% à 6,91 EUR, Maurel et Prom 0,72% à 8 EUR. afp/fr

-=-=-TEXT: Free a recruté 420.000 clients supplémentaires dans le mobile au premier trimestre Le 15/05 à 09:31 Le bond du chiffre d'affaires dans le mobile a compensé la quasi-stagnation des revenus dans le fixe - AFP - Ana Arevalo 1 / 1 Iliad, la maison-mère de Free, a vu son chiffre d'affaires progresser de 7,0% au premier trimestre. Les bonnes performances dans le mobile compensent la quasi-stagnation dans le fixe. L'opérateur télécoms Iliad vu son chiffre d'affaires progresser de 7,0% au premier trimestre. Il a atteint 1,07 milliards d'euros, selon le communiqué publié ce vendredi matin . La maison-mère de Free, qui a confirmé anticiper une hausse supérieure à 10% de son résultat d'exploitation ( Ebitda ) cette année, s'est à nouveau imposée en début d'année comme le premier recruteur de nouveaux abonnés dans le mobile avec 420.000 clients supplémentaires. Trois ans après le lancement de ses offres à prix cassés qui ont déclenché une guerre des prix dans le secteur, le groupe de Xavier Niel s'est arrogé 15% du marché du mobile avec un total de 10,5 millions de clients. Son chiffre d'affaires dans le mobile a bondi de 18,5% au premier trimestre pour s'établir à 437,9 millions d'euros, contrebalançant la quasi-stagnation (+0,3%) de ses revenus dans le fixe. Forte compétition dans le fixe Dans le fixe, nouveau front de la compétition ces derniers mois avec le lancement d'offres à prix bas par Bouygues Telecom (Bouygues ), l'opérateur a encore séduit 77.000 nouveaux clients mais son revenu moyen par client a reculé pour s'établir à 34,70 euros contre 35,10 euros au 31 décembre 2014. La baisse s'explique pour partie par des opérations promotionnelles, notamment par le biais de ventes privées sur internet. Les analystes de Barclays tablaient sur un gain de 50.000 abonnés dans le fixe et de 375.000 dans le mobile. A titre de comparaison, Bouygues Telecom a recruté 96.000 clients supplémentaires dans le fixe sur la même période, s'imposant comme le premier recruteur de nouveaux abonnés sur ce segment. Accélération des investissements "On a toujours de très bonnes performances commerciales et on accélère nos investissements, notamment dans la 4G avec 1.000 antennes construites dans le trimestre", a déclaré à Reuters le directeur financier de la société, Thomas Reynaud. Selon le dernier décompte de l'agence nationale des fréquences, Free a dépassé le nouveau numéro deux français des télécoms Numericable-SFR en nombre d'antennes de très haut débit mobile "4G" mises en service. Le titre a clôturé jeudi soir en hausse de 0,16% à 216,95 euros, donnant une capitalisation boursière de 12,7 milliards d'euros. Depuis le début de l'année, il affiche une hausse de 9%.

(Boursier.com) — LA TENDANCE 
Après un début de semaine fort difficile, le CAC40 a repris des couleurs hier, pour repasser le cap des 5.000 points. Ce matin, la tendance est plus hésitante puisque l'indice phare parisien progresse de 0,19% à 5.039 points après 30 minutes de négociations. Ce sont les indicateurs macroéconomiques américains qui devraient déterminer la teneur de la couleur des indices ce soir, avec notamment la production industrielle et la confiance des consommateurs au programme. 
ECO ET DEVISES 
Aux Etats-Unis, l'indice 'Empire State' d'activité manufacturière de la Fed de New York (14h30 : consensus 5) précèdera la production industrielle américaine d'avril (15h15 : consensus +0,0% m/m) et l'indice du sentiment des consommateurs américains de l'Université du Michigan et Reuters (16h00 : consensus 95,9). Aucune statistique d'envergure n'est programmée en Europe. 
La parité euro / dollar atteint 1,1409 ce matin. Le baril de Brent se négocie 66,63$ et le WTI 59,68$ pour l'échéance de juin. L'once d'or se traite 1.219$ (-0,11%). 
VALEURS EN HAUSSE 
* Lexibook (+15,4% à 2,62 euros), boostée par la publication du chiffre d'affaires du dernier trimestre 2014-2015, en nette amélioration. Il ne s'agit pas vraiment d'une prouesse dans la mesure où les revenus étaient négatifs un an plus tôt sur la période, à cause de nombreux retours produits après des méventes, notamment dans les tablettes. Cependant avec 5,5 ME de revenus, ce dernier trimestre 2014-2015 est meilleur que ceux des précédents exercices affichant un profil moins atypique que celui de 2013-2014 (2,5 ME en 2012-2013, 1,4 ME en 2011-2012 et 2,9 ME en 2010-2011). Le management a plusieurs fers au feu, notamment l'annonce prochaine d'une nouvelle licence d'envergure, et estime pouvoir dégager une croissance rentable sur le nouvel exercice. 
* Thales (+2,2% à 55,15 euros) affiche la plus forte hausse du CAC40, soutenu par la recommandation "surpondérer" de Barclays, qui a relevé de 52 à 60 euros sa valorisation, selon nos informations. Le titre bénéficie toujours d'une belle cote d'amour parmi les analystes de la place, avec 8 avis favorables et 3 neutres sur les 11 derniers commentaires d'analystes, pour un objectif moyen de 57,15 euros (fourchette de 50 à 69 euros). 
* ArcelorMittal (+2% à 10,5 euros) après avoir bondi de près de 6% la veille, toujours dopé par la décision de la Commission européenne. Le régulateur a ouvert une enquête antidumping sur la Chine et la Russie, ces deux pays étant soupçonnés de vendre un type d'acier sur le marché européen à des prix inférieurs à leurs coûts de production. 'enquête fait suite à une plainte déposée en avril par Eurofer, la fédération professionnelle des sidérurgistes, affirmant que la Russie et la Chine vendent à des prix de "dumping" des produits d'acier laminé à froid, utilisés pour l'automobile et le BTP, sur le marché européen, causant un sérieux préjudice au secteur. Si la Commission confirme les accusations d'Eurofer elle peut imposer des droits de douane, comme elle l'a fait mercredi pour une autre catégorie de produits de l'acier. BofA ML est par ailleurs passé de "neutre" à "acheter" sur le dossier. 
* Iliad (+1,2% à 219,5 euros). Le groupe a démarré le millésime 2015 sur un chiffre d'affaires en hausse de 7% et des recrutements en progression, même si le rythme de hausse dans le fixe est faible dans un marché mature. L'opérateur confirme viser une croissance de son EBITDA supérieure à 10%. 
* EDF (+0,2% à 22,8 euros). La filiale belge Luminus veut faire son entrée en bourse. L'opération, prévue sur Euronext Bruxelles, pourrait avoir lieu d'ici la fin de l'année, si les conditions sont réunies, a indiqué l'entreprise actuellement détenue à 65,3% par l'énergéticien français. 
VALEURS EN BAISSE 
* ASK (-3,6% à 2,4 euros). Le spécialiste des solutions sans contact reste pénalisé par une publication trimestrielle décevante. Jean-Baptiste André —©2015, Boursier.com

Par Herve Rousseau | Publié le 15/05/2015 à 09:17 | Mise à jour le 15/05/2015 à 09:17 | Réactions ( 0 ) Crédit Photo : © Finbarr O'Reilly / Reuters/REUTERS Après sa belle hausse de la veille, le CAC 40 ralenti la cadence ce matin. La Bourse de Paris avait rebomdi hier grâce notamment à une accalmie sur les marchés obligataires. 
La Bourse de Paris garde sa bonne humeur en cette fin de semaine qui s’annonce calme en l’absence d’indicateurs macroéconomiques de premier plan. Dans les premiers échanges, le CAC 40 avance de 0,40 % à 5.049,56 points. 
Hier, après trois séances consécutives de repli, le marché parisien était reparti de l’avant. Le CAC 40 avait grimpé de 1,36 % repassant ainsi le seuil symbolique des 5.000 points. De son côté, Wall Street a aussi fortement grimpé hier, encouragée par un rebond du marché obligataire. 
En début de semaine, le marché parisien avait été déstabilisé par d’importantes turbulences sur les marchés obligataires. Les rendements de la dette publique se sont en effet nettement tendus après avoir atteint des records de faiblesse le mois dernier, grâce la politique ultragénéreuse menée par la Banque centrale européenne (BCE). 
Hier, les investisseurs ont été rassurés par le discours tenu par le président de l’institution. Mario Draghi a souligné l’efficacité de sa politique monétaire, répétant que son vaste programme de relance serait appliqué «dans son entier». 
Aujourd’hui, les marchés resteront par ailleurs attentifs aux négociations entre la Grèce et ses créanciers. Le gouvernement grec, en quête urgente d’un accord avec ses créanciers pour toucher une tranche de prêts vitale, souhaite mettre cette question au menu d’un sommet européen prévu à Riga la semaine prochaine , normalement consacré à l’Europe orientale. 
Sur le marché des changes, l’euro recule légèrement face au dollar sur des prises de bénéfices. La monnaie unique européenne valait 1,1395 dollar contre 1,1414 la veille. Mercredi celle-ci a atteint 1,1445 dollar, son niveau le plus fort depuis trois mois. Les cours du pétrole sont en revanche en baisse, les marchés peinant à entrevoir la fin de la surabondance de l’offre. Le prix du baril de «light sweet crude» (WTI) cède 15 cents, à 59,73 dollars, dans les premiers échanges électroniques, le baril de Brent de la mer du Nord perdant lui six cents, à 66,64 dollars. Les valeurs à suivre 
Iliad (+0,85% à 218,80 euros) , la maison mère de l’opérateur télécoms Free, a publié un chiffre d’affaires en hausse de 7 % au premier trimestre à 1,075 milliard d’euros et dépassé la barre des 16 millions d’abonnés fixes et mobiles.

-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: Free : 497 000 abonnements de plus et chiffre d'affaires en hausse Un delta d'un million avec Numericable-SFR 35 Finances Free vient de dévoiler son bilan du premier trimestre avec, cette fois encore, un recrutement massif sur le mobile, tandis que sur le fixe le FAI ne parvient pas à faire mieux que Bouygues Telecom, et ce, malgré le lancement de la Freebox mini 4K en fin de période. Au total, Free revendique 497 000 abonnements de plus. 
La valse des résultats des FAI et des opérateurs prend fin avec la mise en ligne des résultats de Free Mobile. Alors que le chiffre d'affaires de ses concurrents est généralement en baisse, Iliad annonce une hausse de 7 % sur un an avec 1,074 milliard d'euros sur les trois premiers mois de l'année. Dans le détail, le fixe grimpe très légèrement (+0,3 % à 639,7 millions), tandis que le mobile augmente de 18,5 % avec 437,9 millions d'euros. Free : 77 000 clients de mieux sur le fixe, mais un ARPU toujours en baisse 
Si l'on regarde du côté des abonnés, le nombre de clients Free haut débit est en hausse de 77 000 pour atteindre 5,945 millions. Le FAI est donc le deuxième au niveau du recrutement, juste devant Orange , mais derrière Bouygues Telecom . Pour rappel, la Freebox mini 4K a été dévoilée le 10 mars et une partie des 77 000 nouveaux clients vient évidemment de là, mais la proportion n'est pas précisée, dommage. 
L'ARPU moyen, c'est à dire le revenu moyen par utilisateur est encore en baisse à 34,70 euros, contre 35,10 euros le trimestre précédent et 35,5 euros encore avant. Le FAI indique que ce chiffre est « mécaniquement impacté par les offres promotionnelles » (voir notre analyse ). Free indique que plus de 700 000 clients profitent du très haut débit (plus de 30 Mb/s), mais sans donner le détail entre le VDSL2 et la fibre . 420 000 abonnements de plus sur le mobile, Bouygues Telecom en ligne de mire 
Sur le mobile, Free revendique désormais 10,525 millions d'abonnements, soit 420 000 de plus en trois mois. Un excellent score, mais un peu en baisse par rapport aux trimestres précédents : 1er trimestre 2014 : 5,711 millions dans le fixe (+71 000) et 8.635 millions dans le mobile (+595 000) 2e trimestre 2014 : 5,735 millions dans le fixe (+24 000) et 9.095 millions dans le mobile (+460 000) 3e trimestre 2014 : 5.805 millions dans le fixe (+70 000) et 9.575 millions dans le mobile (+480 000) 4e trimestre 2014 : 5.868 millions dans le fixe (+63 000) et 10,105 millions dans le mobile (+530 000) 1er trimestre 2015 : 5,945 millions dans le fixe (+77 000) et 10,525 millions dans le mobile (+420 000) 
Comme toujours, voici la répartition des quatre principaux opérateurs sur le premier trimestre 2015. Comme on peut le remarquer, Free Mobile s'approche de Bouygues Telecom sur le mobile et l'écart entre les deux n'est plus que de 748 000 abonnements. D'ici le troisième trimestre, Free pourrait donc prendre la troisième place au rythme actuel. On remarque également que Free a augmenté sa base client de 497 000, tandis que Numericable-SFR en a perdu quasiment autant (502 000) : 
Bouygues Telecom : Fixe : 2,524 millions (+96 000) Mobile : 11,273 millions (+152 000) Total : 13,549 millions (+248 000) 
Free Mobile : Fixe : 5,945 millions (+77 000) Mobile : 10,525 millions (+420 000) Total : 16,47 millions (+497 000) 
Orange : Fixe : 10,421 millions (+75 000) Mobile : 27,280 millions (+193 000) Total : 37,701 millions (+268 000) 
Numericable-SFR : Fixe : 6,520 millions (- 57 000) Mobile : 22,494 millions (- 445 000) Total : 29,014 millions (- 502 000) Publiée le 15/05/2015 à 08:30

(Tradingsat.com) - Iliad a réalisé au premier trimestre 2015 un chiffre d'affaires de près de 1,1 milliard d'euros, en progression de 7% par rapport à la même période de l'année précédente. 
Alors que l'activité mobile a poursuivi sa dynamique de croissance (+18,5% à 437,9 millions d'euros), le Fixe s'est stabilisé (+0,3% à 639,7 millions d'euros) dans un marché concurrentiel.

PARIS/LONDRES (Reuters) - Les principales Bourses européennes ont ouvert en légère hausse vendredi, soutenues comme la veille par le sentiment que les tensions sur le marché obligataire commencent à s'apaiser. 
À Paris, l'indice CAC 40 avance de 0,39% à 5.049,65 points vers 7h40 GMT. À Francfort, le Dax prend 0,42% et à Londres, le FTSE gagne 0,37%. 
L'indice EuroStoxx 50 de la zone euro progresse de 0,36% et le FTSEurofirst 300 de 0,4%. 
L'indice sectoriel des valeurs liées à l'énergie est le seul à être dans le rouge à ce stade de la séance. 
Un fort rebond des rendements obligataires allemands et américains a récemment pesé sur les actions en les rendant moins attractives que la dette souveraine. Certains investisseurs en ont profité pour réduire leurs positions boursières après le rally du marché au premier trimestre. 
Mais les craintes d'un crash obligataire semblent se calmer. 
"Le courant massif de ventes sur le marché obligataire semble vouloir se tasser après un recul assez spectaculaire sur une période très courte", commente l'analyste de marché d'Oanda Craig Erlam, qui juge la chute d'autant plus surprenante que la Banque centrale européenne (BCE) réalise des rachats massifs. 
L'annonce par Mario Draghi jeudi à Washington que la BCE ira jusqu'au bout de son programme d'assouplissement quantitatif (QE) a aussi rassuré les investisseurs. 
Aux valeurs, Iliad gagne 1,18% après avoir fait état d'une hausse de 7,0% de son chiffre d'affaires au premier trimestre, la conquête de nouveaux clients dans le mobile ayant compensé la forte compétition dans le fixe. 
ArcelorMittal (+2,1%), plus forte hausse du CAC, continue à tirer la cote avec l'ensemble de la sidérurgie en Europe après l'ouverture par la Commission européenne d'une enquête antidumping sur de l'acier laminé à froid chinois et russe. L'indice Thomson Reuters des sidérurgistes en Europe prend 1,26%. 
Thales (+2,04% à 55,43 euros) affiche la plus forte hausse du SBF120. Barclays, à l'achat sur le titre, a relevé son objectif de cours à 60 euros. 
Le groupe suisse Roche prend 3%, plus forte hausse de l'EuroFirst 300, après avoir annoncé de bons résultats d'essais cliniques concernant un médicament contre le cancer. 
Syngenta (+0,4%) s'est stabilisé après avoir débuté la séance en nette hausse alors que le géant américain des semences Monsanto prépare une nouvelle approche sur le groupe suisse qui pourrait intervenir dans les trois semaines, selon des sources du secteur. 
Le dollar oscille autour de ses plus bas de près de trois mois touchés la veille face à l'euro après l'annonce jeudi d'une baisse des prix à la production qui, après une série d'indicateurs décevants ces dernières semaines, douche les espoirs d'un relèvement rapide des taux de la Réserve fédérale. 
Il se traite autour de 1,14 pour un euro. 
"On n'a jamais cru que la Fed relèverait ses taux le mois prochain mais nous espérions qu'elle préparerait le terrain pour une hausse en septembre", écrit Kathy Lien, de BK Asset Management, dans une note. "Mais si les indicateurs continuent à décevoir elle pourrait même s'abstenir de signaler un changement de politique monétaire trois mois à l'avance." 
Les cours du pétrole reculent légèrement mais s'apprêtent à afficher un petit gain hebdomadaire, soutenus par la faiblesse du dollar et les perspectives de ralentissement de la croissance de la production de brut aux Etats-Unis. Le brut léger américain est en passe d'afficher sa neuvième semaine de hausse d'affilée, sa plus longue phase de gains depuis 1983. 
Sur le plan macroéconomique, les investisseurs attendent entre autres cet après-midi les chiffres de la production industrielle du mois d'avril aux Etats-Unis (13h15 GMT) et l'indice de confiance de l'Université du Michigan (14h00 GMT).

-=-=-TEXT: European Factors to Watch-Equity futures edge up as bond jitters ease off 
(Adds futures prices, company news items) 
LONDON May 15 (Reuters) - European equity index futures advanced on Friday, helped by signs that jitters in the bond market this week were starting to ease off. 
The futures indexes for the euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50, Germany's DAX and France's CAC were all up by around 0.3 percent at 0620 GMT. 
A pick-up this week in benchmark German and U.S. bond yields had made equities look more expensive compared with debt. Some investors trimmed equity positions to cash in on the earlier stock market rally. 
But fears over the bond sell-off seemed to recede on Thursday as the rest of the broader European stock market also recovered, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index finishing 0.7 percent higher. 
"The sell-off in bond markets does appear to be slowing following what was quite a dramatic decline in a very short period of time. This was especially surprising considering the European Central Bank is taking the other side of that trade which usually piles downward pressure on yields but it appears that in a low liquidity and highly anxious market, the central bank has met its max," said Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam. > GLOBAL MARKETS-Asian shares edge down but poised for weekly rise > US STOCKS-S&P 500 ends at record high as dollar loses ground >> TREASURIES-Yields fall as supply eases; German debt steadies > FOREX-Dollar still on the defensive after tough week, economic data eyed > PRECIOUS-Gold near 3-mth high; eyes weekly gain on U.S. rate expectations > METALS-London copper set to close flat for second week > Oil heads for weekly gain, shrugs off ample supply; US output eyed

CARREFOUR /CASINO : 
France's Competition Authority is investigating a proposed alliance between Auchan and Systeme U, two French supermarket chains, after Brussels regulators referred it for review, according to Le Figaro newspaper. The two, which compete with larger companies Carrefour and Casino, had planned to combine their purchasing platforms and put in place broader co-operation that stops short of a complete merger.

German labour union Verdi has called on workers at Deutsche Post to continue walkouts on Friday ahead of a next round of negotiations scheduled for May 20 and 21.

World Duty Free will be taken over by larger rival Dufry to create a travel retail heavyweight with a 25 percent market share. As part of the deal the Swiss group will launch a mandatory tender at 10.25 euros per share (Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta ) Trending On Reuters

-=-=-TEXT: AMERICAN PLAYERS THEATER SPRING GREEN, WIS., JUNE 6-NOV. 22 This Wisconsin mainstay is one of many theater events around the country that does not have the word “festival” in its name, but it bursts to life with a flurry of shows for several months, then hibernates during the winter; so it’s certainly festive. Productions of “A Streetcar Named Desire,” Athol Fugard’s “The Island” and Noël Coward’s “Private Lives” are on the calendar, alongside Shakespeare’s “Othello” and “The Merry Wives of Windsor,” and other productions staged indoors and outside. Don’t forget to visit to Frank Lloyd Wright’s Taliesin estate a few miles away. (americanplayers.org) CHAUTAUQUA CHAUTAUQUA, N.Y., JUNE 27-AUG. 30 Theater is just one element in this arts festival, where each week has a theme — “Redefining Europe” and “Creating Livable Communities” are among the topics this summer — and a series of lectures and other entertainments allow for an immersive experience. On Chautauqua’s stages, catch “Our Town,” “Henry V” and Lynn Nottage’s “Intimate Apparel,” and staged readings of new works by Jason Wells and David West Read (“The Dream of the Burning Boy”). The director Andrew Borba will lead a joint effort of the theater company and the Chautauqua Symphony Orchestra for one special performance (July 16) of “Ellis Island,” by Peter Boyer. (theater.ciweb.org) CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN THEATER FESTIVAL SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.VA., JULY 10-AUG. 2 The activist performance art of the punk group Pussy Riot will overtake Shepherd University in West Virginia soon, or at least its story will. “We Are Pussy Riot,” by Barbara Hammond, is one of five plays in the 25th season at this pioneering festival. Shepherdstown might not immediately spring to mind as a breeding ground for new work, but since Ed Herendeen started this festival in 1991, more than 100 new plays, many of them world premieres, have been staged. Works by Michael Weller, Johnna Adams, Sheila Callaghan and Steven Dietz are also planned. (catf.org) 
Advertisement EAST TO EDINBURGH NEW YORK, JULY 7-26 It’s far away, expensive and it rains a lot, but plenty of theater artists care not and head to the Scottish capital each summer to participate in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the biggest and oldest Fringe festival of all. Once again, 59E59 Theaters will allow New Yorkers who are not en route to Scotland in August to catch some homegrown works before the productions head over. About a dozen American shows, including “Bette Davis Ain’t for Sissies” and “Gary Busey’s One-Man Hamlet,” will be presented during the eclectic three-week event. (59e59.org) 
Advertisement FRINGE FESTIVALS VARIOUS SITES AND DATES Since the first one in Edinburgh in 1947, fringe festivals have become increasingly ubiquitous. It might make for an interesting (if rather zigzag and possibly insane) road trip, actually, to hit the Hollywood Fringe Festival (June 11-28), then head to the St. Lou Fringe (June 17-27), over to Maine for the PortFringe (June 20-28), down to the Capital Fringe in Washington (July 9-26) and finally to the New York International Fringe Festival (Aug. 14-30). An optional extension could include Boulder (Sept. 16-27) and Houston (Sept. 23-27). There are many of these; surely one is close to you. HILLS ALIVE VARIOUS SITES AND DATES This new collaboration has several arts organizations in southern Vermont joining forces and convincing some of us that you could do far worse than spend the entire summer there. Theater-wise, the Dorset Theater Festival season includes John Patrick Shanley’s “Outside Mullingar” (July 30-Aug. 15) among its many offerings; at Weston Playhouse, “Peter and the Starcatcher” (July 16-25) and “The Glass Menagerie” (Aug. 27-Sept. 5) are a couple of the options, and down in Bennington, “Cabaret” (July 10-Aug. 2) will be one of several productions staged at Oldcastle Theater.

The natural backdrop is breathtaking and the work consistently strong. “The Winter’s Tale” and “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” are the contributions this year in a season to also include “The Arabian Nights” and “An Iliad,” the adaptation by Lisa Peterson and Denis O’Hare that has been performed in many theaters — including in Manhattan at New York Theater Workshop — over the past few years.

Video by Oregon Shakespeare Festival OREGON SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL ASHLAND, ORE., THROUGH NOV. 1 This popular destination is celebrating its 80th season, but it’s no stodgy old-timer. In fact, Ashland recently announced three new play commissions, part of its ambitious series “ American Revolutions: The United States History Cycle ,” devoted to new works focusing on significant periods of change in American history. Shakespeare still has pride of place here, and “Pericles,” “Much Ado About Nothing” and “Antony and Cleopatra” will be presented this season alongside several other productions. If you can’t get your fill in the busy, long season, there’s a Shakespeare-theme cruise to look forward to in December. ( osfashland .org)

A lot looks intriguing on the schedule, including another new musical from Duncan Sheik and a workshop of “Desire,” an evening of six short plays based on stories by Tennessee Williams, by the writers Elizabeth Egloff, Marcus Gardley, Rebecca Gilman, David Grimm, John Guare and Beth Henley.

But meaningful theater is always an option, and an important centerpiece to this Bay Area festival is “Armine, Sister.” This American premiere from the Polish company Teatr ZAR reflects — with the help of Anatolian monadic chants — on the annihilation of nearly 1.5 million Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915. The show comes 100 years after the initial atrocity (which the Turkish government has refused to call genocide). This festival focuses on international artists, and Teatr ZAR is one of many en route to San Francisco.

At Shakespeare & Company, John Douglas Thompson, who has played the title roles in “Othello” and “Richard III” there, will star in Lolita Chakrabarti’s “Red Velvet” as Ira Aldridge, the first African-American actor to play Othello.

But in fact, the writings of George Bernard Shaw have long been a jumping-off point, offering the artistic director Jackie Maxwell the opportunity to be inventive as she programs work both by and reflective of Shaw. Fear not, purists, the namesake writer will be represented by “Pygmalion” and “You Never Can Tell.” (shawfest.com) Photo Samuel Valentine and Cassie Layton in “Romeo and Juliet” by Shakespeare’s Globe.

-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: L'activité mobile a poursuivi sa forte croissance sur le 1 er trimestre 2015. Son chiffre d'affaires est en hausse de plus de 18% par rapport à la même période en 2014 pour atteindre près de 438 millions d'euros. Les principales évolutions sur la période ont été les suivantes : n Poursuite de la très bonne dynamique commerciale. Au cours du 1 er trimestre, le Groupe a maintenu son dynamisme commercial dans la lignée des trimestres précédents en restant leader en recrutement d'abonnés pour le 13 ème trimestre consécutif, avec 420 000 nouveaux abonnés nets de résiliations. Ainsi, au 31 mars 2015, le Groupe comptait 10 525 000 abonnés mobiles, soit une part de marché de plus de 15% 1 . n L'innovation demeure au cœur de la stratégie de Free. L'excellente dynamique du Groupe vient confirmer la pertinence de la stratégie d'enrichissement constant des offres commerciales (désormais jusqu'à 4 Forfaits mobile Free à 15,99 euros / mois pour chaque abonnement Freebox), couplée avec la poursuite des efforts dans le développement des services 4G (plus de 950 sites 4G déployés sur le 1 er trimestre 2015, contre près de 400 sites sur la même période en 2014), l'intégration dans le Forfait Free (19,99 euros / mois ou 15,99 euros / mois) de nouvelles destinations en roaming (Canada, Belgique…) et l'attractivité de l'offre de terminaux. Ces mesures ont permis au Groupe d'améliorer la répartition des abonnés dans ses recrutements sur le 1 er trimestre 2015. 
n Un chiffre d'affaires au 31 mars 2015 tiré par la solide hausse du chiffre d'affaires services (+23% vs 31 mars 2014) , grâce à l'amélioration du mix abonnés et aux migrations des abonnés au Forfait 2 euros vers le Forfait Free (19,99 euros / mois).

L'activité fixe du Groupe a poursuivi sa croissance au cours du 1 er trimestre, en affichant une légère hausse de 0,3% et un chiffre d'affaires de 640 millions d'euros. Les principales évolutions de la période sont les suivantes : n Des offres commerciales très attractives. Au cours du 1 er trimestre 2015, le Groupe a recruté 77 000 nouveaux abonnés haut débit (nets de résiliation). Dans un marché concurrentiel, le Groupe réalise une performance exceptionnelle avec 42% des recrutements nets 1 sur le trimestre, grâce à la très forte notoriété de la marque Free, à l'attractivité de l'offre Freebox Révolution ainsi qu'au recours à une vente privée début janvier. n Le lancement de la nouvelle Freebox mini 4K. Le 10 mars 2015, Free lançait sa nouvelle Freebox mini 4K ultra compacte, la 1 ère box au monde 4K sous Android TV TM , disponible pour 29,99 euros / mois. L'innovation est au cœur de cette nouvelle offre du Groupe avec notamment une télécommande à recherche vocale, l'accès à la Ultra Haute Définition et à l'univers des applications d'Android TV TM . 
n Au cours du 1 er trimestre, le Groupe a intensifié ses investissements dans le très haut débit. La migration d'abonnés vers des offres VDSL2 et le FTTH permettent ainsi, au 31 mars 2015, à plus de 700 000 abonnés de bénéficier d'un débit supérieur à 30 Mbit/s.

n Un ARPU Haut Débit proche de 35 euros à 34,70 euros, mécaniquement impacté par les offres promotionnelles. Malgré cet effet négatif, l'ARPU de l'offre Freebox Révolution se maintient à plus de 38,00 euros sur la période. 
Au cours du 1 er trimestre 2015, le Groupe a poursuivi son effort d'investissement dans le déploiement de ses réseaux et confirme ainsi son objectif d'une croissance de l'Ebitda supérieure à 10% en 2015. G LOSSAIRE

-=-=-TEXT: Bourse : maintenant tout va dépendre de Wall Street 15/05/15 à 08:28     ouvrir sur une note globalement stable après sa forte hausse de la veille. L’issue de la séance sera tributaire de nouvelles statistiques aux Etats-Unis, où le S&P 500 a signé hier un nouveau record de clôture. Iliad a publié son chiffre d’affaires trimestriel. Bourse : maintenant tout va dépendre de Wall Street 
Quid après le nouveau record de clôture du S&P 500 hier à Wall Street ? On en saura très vraisemblablement plus ce vendredi alors que se profilent de nouvelles et importantes statistiques économiques aux Etats-Unis . 
Trois indicateurs sont attendus entre 14h30 et 16 heures : l’indice manufacturier « Empire State » de mai, la production industrielle du mois d’avril et l’indice de confiance de l’université du Michigan de mai. Après la mauvaise surprise du mois d’avril, qui avait montré une contraction surprise de l’activité industrielle dans la région de New York - l’indice Empire State a chuté à -1,19, son premier passage en territoire négatif depuis décembre -, le consensus se veut optimiste et table sur un rebond de l’indicateur à 5. Stabilisation espérée de la production industrielle 
Il en va de même pour la production industrielle. Elle a décliné pour la première fois depuis 2008 au cours du premier trimestre, mais un rebond est espéré même si les effets négatifs liés à la chute des cours du pétrole pourraient encore peser. En avril, la production est attendue parfaitement stable. Quant à la confiance du consommateur, elle est devenue plus volatile ces derniers mois sous le double impact des prix de l’essence et d’indicateurs macroéconomiques américains mitigés. Une légère hausse à 96, contre 95,9 en mars, est anticipée. 
En attendant, les opérateurs ont salué hier à New York de bons chiffres sur le front de l’emploi, les inscriptions hebdomadaires au chômage ayant, contre toute attente, légèrement reculé à 264.000, la moyenne à quatre semaines s’inscrivant au passage au plus bas de 15 ans, tandis que les prix à la production, déjouant eux aussi les anticipations du consensus, reculaient fortement, de 0,4%, contre une hausse de 0,1% attendue. Ces signes d’inflation qui manquent pourtant cruellement à la Fed en vue de figer un peu mieux l’horizon de sa première remontée de taux d’intérêt. L’apaisement sur le front du dollar et des rendements a fourni les autres éléments qui ont poussé le S&P 500 à signer ce nouveau record de clôture, ce qui n’était pas arrivé depuis le 24 avril. 
A une demi-heure des premiers échanges, le contrat future Cac 40 prend symboliquement 3 points. 
A noter que les agences de notation seront également à la manœuvre ce vendredi. Fitch passera en revue la note souveraine de la Grèce , actuellement à CCC (perspective négative), S&P se penchera sur le cas de l’Italie, pays noté BBB- (perspective stable) et Moody’s se prononcera sur l’Irlande, qu’elle crédite aujourd’hui d’un Baa1 (perspective stable). 420.000 nouveaux abonnés au mobile d’Iliad 
Du côté des entreprises, Iliad a annoncé une hausse de 7% de son chiffre d'affaires au premier trimestre, la poursuite de conquêtes de nouveaux clients dans le mobile ayant permis de compenser la forte compétition dans le fixe. La maison-mère de Free a recruté 420.000 nouveaux abonnés mobiles sur la période, soit une part de marché de plus de 15%, et 77.000 dans le fixe, mais avec un revenu moyen par client en baisse. Iliad confirme son objectif d’une hausse supérieure à 10% de son résultat d'exploitation (Ebitda) cette année. 
Selon le Süddeutsche Zeitung , le ministère allemand de la Défense a décidé d'acquérir le système de défense antimissile MEADS, fabriqué par le constructeur de missiles européen MBDA, filiale à 37,5% d’ Airbus Group , pour succéder au système Patriot. Berlin a déclaré que la décision ne sera prise qu’à la fin du deuxième trimestre. 
Du côté des analystes, Barclays, à « surpondérer » sur Thales , relève son objectif de cours de 52 à 60 euros. Goldman Sachs fait de même sur Eiffage , de 63 à 65 euros, en recommandant l’achat. Bank of America passe de « neutre » à « achat » sur ArcelorMittal . Le broker reprend par ailleurs la couverture d’ Ingenico et de Gemalto avec des recommandations respectives d’achat et « neutre » et des objectifs de 131 et 84 euros.

Le groupe Iliad-Free affiche un chiffre d’affaires en hausse de 7%. L’offre Free Mobile se montre toujours aussi attractive. La bataille du haut débit est plus ardue. 
Le groupe Iliad-Free entretient sa dynamique commerciale sur le premier trimestre 2015 avec un chiffre d’affaires en hausse de 7% pour dépasser le milliard de chiffre d’affaires (1,07 milliard d’euros). 
Le business de Free dans la mobilité progresse de 18% à 438 millions d’euros. Il continue d’aspirer des nouveaux abonnés mobiles (420 000 sur le T1 2015) pour afficher une base de 10,5 millions de clients sur ce segment. Free Mobile avait déjà atteint la barre des 10 millions lors du quatrième trimestre 2014. 
Ce qui permet au « nouvel entrant » de revendiquer une part de marché de 15% (évaluation interne qu’Iliad-Free avait déjà présentée à ses actionnaires en mars) face à son trio de concurrents (Orange, Numericable-SFR et Bouygues Telecom). 
Pour le début d’année, Free Mobile a élargi l’accès à un Forfait Free Mobile au sein des foyers (jusqu’à 4 pour chaque abonnement Freebox) et complète la liste de destinations internationales afin de réduire les coûts de roaming (Canada, Belgique…). 
En avril, Free Mobile déclare qu’il continue « d’investir massivement » pour poursuivre le déploiement de son réseau mobile. Objectif : couvrir 90% de la population d’ici janvier 2018 et environ 60% de la population en 4G fin 2015. 
Dans le fixe, la conquête se poursuit également mais c’est plus compliqué de gravir les échelons au regard de la concurrence entre acteurs FAI. Le chiffre d’affaires est en hausse de 0,3% (640 millions d’euros). 
Le FAI a recruté 77 000 nouveaux abonnés haut débit (nets de résiliation). Ce qui lui permet de s’attribuer une part de marché de 42% dans les recrutements clients sur le trimestre par rapport à la concurrence. 
Le 10 mars, Free avait lancé sa nouvelle Freebox mini 4K sous le signe de l’innovation. 
L’ARPU, c’est-à-dire le revenu moyen par abonné, se situe à 35 euros (38 euros pour le segment Freebox Revolution). 
Sur le front du très haut débit (c’est-à-dire supérieur à 30 Mbit/s), Iliad-Free affiche 700 000 abonnés ayant opté pour le VDSL 2 ou la fibre à domicile (FTTH). 
A la Bourse de Paris en matinée, le titre d’Iliad-Free est en légère hausse : +0,92% (218,95 euros).

CHIFFRE D'AFFAIRES CONSOLIDE DU 1 ERE TRIMESTRE 2015 Le chiffre d'affaires consolidé du Groupe progresse de 7% sur le trimestre, pour atteindre 1 075 millions d'euros au 31 mars 2015 (contre 1 005 millions d'euros au 31 mars 2014) . Cette forte croissance s'explique principalement par le dynamisme commercial des offres mobiles. 

En millions d'euros 

Mobile : L'activité mobile a poursuivi sa forte croissance sur le 1 er trimestre 2015. Son chiffre d'affaires est en hausse de plus de 18% par rapport à la même période en 2014 pour atteindre près de 438 millions d'euros. Les principales évolutions sur la période ont été les suivantes : 
Poursuite de la très bonne dynamique commerciale. Au cours du 1 er trimestre, le Groupe a maintenu son dynamisme commercial dans la lignée des trimestres précédents en restant leader en recrutement d'abonnés pour le 13 ème trimestre consécutif, avec 420 000 nouveaux abonnés nets de résiliations. Ainsi, au 31 mars 2015, le Groupe comptait 10 525 000 abonnés mobiles, soit une part de marché de plus de 15% 1 . 
L'innovation demeure au coeur de la stratégie de Free. L'excellente dynamique du Groupe vient confirmer la pertinence de la stratégie d'enrichissement constant des offres commerciales (désormais jusqu'à 4 Forfaits mobile Free à 15,99 euros / mois pour chaque abonnement Freebox), couplée avec la poursuite des efforts dans le développement des services 4G (plus de 950 sites 4G déployés sur le 1 er trimestre 2015, contre près de 400 sites sur la même période en 2014), l'intégration dans le Forfait Free (19,99 euros / mois ou 15,99 euros / mois) de nouvelles destinations en roaming (Canada, Belgique...) et l'attractivité de l'offre de terminaux. Ces mesures ont permis au Groupe d'améliorer la répartition des abonnés dans ses recrutements sur le 1 er trimestre 2015. 
Un chiffre d'affaires au 31 mars 2015 tiré par la solide hausse du chiffre d'affaires services (+23% vs 31 mars 2014) , grâce à l'amélioration du mix abonnés et aux migrations des abonnés au Forfait 2 euros vers le Forfait Free (19,99 euros / mois). 
Fixe : L'activité fixe du Groupe a poursuivi sa croissance au cours du 1 er trimestre, en affichant une légère hausse de 0,3% et un chiffre d'affaires de 640 millions d'euros. Les principales évolutions de la période sont les suivantes : 
Des offres commerciales très attractives 
. Au cours du 1 er trimestre 2015, le Groupe a recruté 77 000 nouveaux abonnés haut débit (nets de résiliation) .

-=-=-TEXT: Télécoms : Free poursuit sa croissance, le marché se stabilise Le Monde | | Par Sarah Belouezzane 
Iliad, la maison mère de Free, a clôturé, vendredi 15 mai, la « saison » des résultats trimestriels. Chez les opérateurs de télécommunications français tout du moins. L’occasion d’un petit bilan de situation. D’autant que cela fait maintenant trois ans que Free a fait son entrée sur le secteur du mobile avec des tarifs qui ont obligé tous les concurrents (Orange, SFR, Bouygues Telecom) à s’aligner et à rogner leurs marges. Quel est l’état de santé financier des quatre opérateurs ? 
Iliad, le groupe fondé par Xavier Niel (par ailleurs actionnaire à titre personnel du Monde ) a affiché un chiffre d’affaires de 1,1 milliard d’euros, en croissance de 7 % sur un an pour le premier trimestre. L’excédent brut d’exploitation n’a pas été dévoilé, mais le groupe assure qu’il est en croissance de 10 %. 
Chez les concurrents, que la guerre des prix a plongés dans une crise sans précédent, la situation reste difficile. Bouygues Telecom, autrefois plus grand contributeur au dividende de sa maison mère, est en déficit depuis 2012. L’opérateur, qui a publié ses résultats du premier trimestre mercredi 13 mai, a affiché un déficit de 49 millions d’euros. 
SFR, racheté par Numericable en novembre 2014, et qui a accusé des pertes sur l’ensemble de l’année dernière, est revenu dans le vert au premier trimestre. L’opérateur a réalisé 816 millions d’euros de bénéfices. Hors éléments exceptionnels, son résultat net redescend toutefois à 132 millions d’euros. 
Orange, dont le chiffre d’affaires n’a cessé de décroître sur les trois dernières années, a amorti ce recul au premier trimestre, avec une baisse de 1,4 %, à 9,67 milliards d'euros. Le bénéfice avant intérêts et impôts (Ebitda) s'est établi à 2,91 milliards d'euros, en baisse à base comparable, mais le recul est deux fois moindre que l'année précédente. Comment évoluent les « portefeuilles » d’abonnés ? 
Free est toujours en croissance. Sur les trois premiers mois de l’année, l’opérateur a attiré 420 000 abonnés mobiles pour atteindre 10,5 millions de clients au total. Le fixe a séduit 77 000 nouveaux abonnés, portant le nombre total à 5,9 millions. 
Chez Bouygues Telecom, la stratégie d’acquisition de nouveaux abonnés semble fonctionner : l’opérateur en a récupéré 96 000 dans le haut débit fixe sur les trois premiers mois de l’année. 
Bouygues Telecom a réduit ses prix afin de conquérir de nouveaux clients et de se renforcer sur le fixe. Métier qui lui avait cruellement fait défaut lorsqu’il a fallu résister à l’onde de choc créée par l’arrivée de Free. 
Chez SFR, les abonnés, eux, en revanche, ont massivement déserté : 500 000 d’entre eux ont quitté le parc mobile de l’opérateur. « Pour l’instant ça va, mais il ne faudrait pas que ça dure » , indique un analyste. 
Orange, lui, continue de bénéficier de ses investissements dans la 4G et le très haut débit fixe. Les ventes nettes de forfaits mobiles ont atteint 164 000 unités au premier trimestre, soit près du double de celles réalisées un an plus tôt. Sur le développement de la fibre optioque, le groupe revendique 75 000 clients supplémentaires.

-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: Numerosos operadores de telefonía celular planean bloquear la publicidad en sus redes, preparando el escenario para una batalla contra compañías de medios digitales tales como Google, AOL y Yahoo.
Un proveedor europeo de servicios inalámbricos declaró al Financial Times que ha instalado el software de bloqueo en sus centros de datos y que planea ponerlo en funcionamiento antes de finales de 2015.
El software impide que la mayor parte de los anuncios publicitarios aparezcan en páginas web y aplicaciones, aunque no interfiere con los anuncios "in feed" del tipo que utilizan Facebook y Twitter.
La tecnología de bloqueo fue desarrollada por Shine, una compañía "startup" israelí cuyos accionistas incluyen a Horizon Ventures, el fondo de inversión de Li Ka-shing, el individuo más rico de Asia.
El Sr. Li también controla Hutchison Whampoa, uno de los grupos de telecomunicaciones más grandes del mundo.
"Decenas de millones de suscriptores móviles en todo el mundo elegirán bloquear los anuncios para fin de año", aseguró Roi Carthy, director de marketing de Shine. "Si esto aumenta, pudiera tener un impacto devastador en la industria publicitaria en línea".
Verizon, el mayor grupo estadounidense de telecomunicaciones, pagó esta semana $4.4 mil millones para comprar AOL, tratando de asegurarse una posición en el vertiginoso mercado publicitario de los dispositivos móviles.
Los expertos en mercadotecnia gastarán casi $69 mil millones este año en anuncios para celulares - más del triple de la suma que gastaron hace dos años - según el grupo de investigación eMarketer.
Shine declaró que estaba trabajando con varios operadores - entre ellos uno con casi 40 millones de suscriptores - aunque se negó a nombrarlos.
Un ejecutivo de una operadora europea confirmó que su compañía, así como las de varios de sus colegas, planea comenzar el bloqueo de anuncios este año.
El ejecutivo señaló que la operadora inicialmente ofrecerá un servicio libre de publicidad a los clientes basado en una opción que les permita elegirlo.
Pero también está considerando una idea más radical que llama "la bomba", la cual se aplicaría simultáneamente a través de toda su red de millones de suscriptores. La idea es concentrarse específicamente en Google, bloqueando la publicidad en sus sitios web en un intento de obligar a la empresa a compartir parte de sus ingresos.
La compañía de Silicon Valley es la empresa publicitaria más grande del mundo, generando $60 mil millones al año a través de búsquedas, YouTube y servicios tales como Google Display Network y DoubleClick, ambos encargados de distribuir anuncios de sitios de terceros. El ejecutivo de la operadora de telefonía celular que está considerando el uso de "la bomba", reconoció que ‘atacar' a Google pudiera ser riesgoso, tanto desde el punto de vista legal como del de relaciones públicas. Bajo las reglas de "neutralidad de la red" en la Unión Europea y EEUU, las empresas de telecomunicaciones están obligadas a tratar todos los datos que fluyen a través de sus redes igualmente.
Pero incluso dentro de esos mercados, sería factible bloquear anuncios en Google "sólo durante una hora o un día" para llevar a la empresa a la mesa de negociaciones, declaró el ejecutivo.
Numerosos operadores de telefonía móvil se sienten descontentos ante el hecho de que las compañías de medios digitales se benefician de sus redes de alta velocidad sin tener que invertir en la infraestructura que las apoyan. El enfado aumentó el mes pasado cuando Google lanzó el Project Fi, su propia operadora de telefonía celular en EEUU.
Google señaló que sería irracional que los operadores bloquearan anuncios, argumentando que: "La gente paga por los paquetes de Internet móviles para que tener acceso a aplicaciones, transmisión en directo de videos ("streaming"), correo vía web y otros servicios que les encantan, muchos de los cuales son financiados por anuncios. Google y otras empresas de la web invierten considerablemente en el desarrollo de estos servicios, así como en la infraestructura correspondiente para ofrecerlos".
Es probable que el bloqueo de la publicidad en las redes móviles provoque una reacción negativa por parte de las compañías de medios digitales. En 2013, Free, el proveedor de servicios de Internet francés propiedad de Iliad, bloqueó anuncios por defecto a través de su módem Freebox, ocasionando una enorme controversia. Como resultado, se vio obligado a descartar la iniciativa en una semana bajo la presión del gobierno socialista.
El Sr. Carthy de Shine indicó que la eliminación de anuncios intrusivos es un "derecho de los consumidores", incluso si socava el modelo de negocio de los editores en línea que se basan en la publicidad.
"La publicidad en línea está fuera de control y está contaminando la experiencia del usuario", comentó. Las ventanas emergentes ("pop-ups"), la reproducción automática de videos y otras formas de publicidad digital pueden consumir entre un 10 y un 50 por ciento del plan de datos de un suscriptor, agregó.
Aunque el bloqueo de publicidad es un fenómeno nuevo en los teléfonos celulares, está más establecido en las computadoras personales y continúa creciendo rápidamente. Más de 140 millones de personas - o el 5 por ciento de la población en línea - utilizan software como Adblock Plus para eliminar anuncios cuando navegan por el Internet en computadoras portátiles o computadoras de escritorio.
Como reportó el Financial Times en febrero, Google, Microsoft y Amazon le han pagado a los creadores de Adblock Plus para permitir que algunos anuncios en sus sitios pasen a través de sus filtros.
La relación de Google con el bloqueo de publicidad se complica aún más por el hecho de que este tipo de software es la adición gratuita más popular de Chrome, su popular navegador de Internet.

-=-=-TEXT: le vendredi 15 mai 2015 L'opérateur poursuit sa croissance. Pour la présentation de ses résultats, Iliad (Free et Free Mobile) indique que le nombre de ses abonnés au service mobile dépasse à présent les 10,5 millions. Free Mobile affiche à nouveau de bons résultats pour le premier trimestre de l'année. L'opérateur de téléphonie mobile fait progresser le nombre de ses utilisateurs, et atteint 10,52 millions d'abonnés sur le territoire. Si aucune ventilation entre les offres gratuites et les autres n'est donnée, la société signe là de bons chiffres. Globalement, la croissance de Free Mobile reste stable. L'opérateur précise avoir séduit pas moins de 420 000 nouveaux adhérents à ses offres mobiles sur le premier trimestre. Un chiffre légèrement en deçà des derniers trimestres mais qui permet au groupe de rester dans le vert. La société explique ces bons résultats par l'enrichissement régulier de ses offres (nouvelles destinations en roaming) et par la possibilité de coupler une offre mobile à Internet fixe. Sur le fixe justement, le FAI indique être en progression même si elle demeure moins marquée. Au pointage de mars 2015, Free détient 5,94 millions d'abonnés au haut débit (plus de 700 000 à la fibre). Quant aux revenus générés par cette activité, ils demeurent en faible croissance, à 0,3%. L'opérateur ne donne enfin aucune information concernant les premières retombées commerciales de la Freebox mini 4K . Toujours est-il qu'Iliad, la maison-mère de Free et Free Mobile se porte bien. Le groupe publie un chiffre d'affaires en progression de 7%, à 1,074 milliard d'euros. Un élément dû en partie aux bons résultats de son activité mobile, cette dernière progresse de 18,5%, pour atteindre 437,9 millions d'euros. A lire également

-=-=-TITLE: Mobile operators plan to block online advertising
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: Several mobile operators plan to block advertising on their networks, setting the stage for a battle with digital media companies such as Google , AOL and Yahoo .
One European wireless carrier told the Financial Times that it has installed blocking software in its data centres and planned to turn it on before the end of 2015.
The software prevents most types of advertising from loading in web pages and apps, though it does not interfere with "in-feed" ads of the kind used by Facebook and Twitter .
The blocking technology was developed by Shine, an Israeli start-up whose shareholders include Horizon Ventures, the investment fund of Li Ka-shing, Asia's richest person.
Justin Sullivan | Getty Images Mr Li also controls Hutchison Whampoa , one of the world's largest telecoms groups.
"Tens of millions of mobile subscribers around the world will be opting in to ad blocking by the end of the year," said Roi Carthy, chief marketing officer of Shine. "If this scales, it could have a devastating impact on the online advertising industry."
Verizon , the largest US telecoms group, this week paid $4.4bn to buy AOL , seeking to gain a foothold in the rapidly growing market for advertising on mobile devices.
Marketers will spend almost $69 billion this year on mobile ads — more than triple the sum they spent two years ago — according to research group eMarketer.
Shine said it was working with a number of operators, including one with almost 40 million subscribers, though it declined to name them.
An executive at a European carrier confirmed that it and several of its peers are planning to start blocking adverts this year.
The executive said that the carrier will initially launch an advertising-free service for customers on an opt-in basis.
But it is also considering a more radical idea that it calls "the bomb", which would apply across its entire network of millions of subscribers at once. The idea is to specifically target Google, blocking advertising on its websites in an attempt to force the company into giving up a cut of its revenues.
What's working on mobile
Marketing software company HubSpot reported strong Q1 earnings. Its CEO Brian Halligan, discusses how the company is adapting to the changing mobile environment.
The Silicon Valley company is the world's largest advertising business, generating $60 billion a year from search, YouTube, and services such as Google Display Network and DoubleClick, which both deliver ads for third-party sites.
The executive at the mobile operator considering "the bomb" acknowledged that targeting Google could be risky from both a legal and public relations perspective. Under "net neutrality" rules in the European Union and the US, telecoms companies are forced to treat all data that flow through their networks equally.
But even within those markets, it would be feasible to block adverts on Google "just for an hour or a day" to bring the company to the negotiating table, the executive said.
More from the Financial Times:
Online arms race heats up over adverts
Screens collide in clash over advertising
Verizon looks to AOL for mobile ads edge
Many mobile operators are frustrated that digital media companies profit from their high-speed networks without having to invest in the infrastructure behind them. Such irritation was inflamed last month when Google launched Project Fi, its own wireless carrier in the US.
Google said it would be unreasonable for mobile operators to block ads, arguing that: "People pay for mobile internet packages so they can access the apps, video streaming, webmail and other services they love, many of which are funded by ads. Google and other web companies invest heavily in developing these services — and in the behind-the-scenes infrastructure to deliver them."
Blocking advertising on mobile networks is likely to provoke a fierce backlash from digital media companies. In 2013, Free, the French internet service provider owned by Iliad, blocked ads by default through its Freebox modem, causing huge controversy. It was forced to scrap the initiative within a week under pressure from the Socialist government.
Mr Carthy of Shine said that eliminating intrusive adverts is a "consumer right", even if it undermines the business model of online publishers that rely on advertising.
"Online advertising is out of control and it's polluting the user experience," he said. Pop-ups, auto-playing videos and other forms of digital advertising can consume between 10 and 50 per cent of a mobile subscriber's data plan, he added.
While ad-blocking is a new phenomenon on mobiles, it is more established on PCs and growing quickly. More than 140m people, or 5 per cent of the online population, use software such as Adblock Plus to eliminate adverts when browsing the web on laptops or desktop computers.
As the Financial Times reported in February, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have paid the makers of Adblock Plus to allow some ads on their sites to slip through its filters.
Google's relationship with ad-blocking is further complicated by the fact that such software is the most popular type of free add-on to Chrome, its popular web browser.

Version at BMCR home site 
In 1959 the author of this book entered Columbia University, the latest of several generations of males in his family to study there. 1 In the Graduate School, where he majored in English and Comparative Literature, one of his formative experiences was to work in the Classics Library under the gaze of Charles Anthon, whose full-length portrait hung there. Sypher resolved that one day he would write about Anthon; but when he proposed the topic to Gilbert Highet, his Classics professor, Highet pointed him instead at Lewis and Short's Latin dictionary, a book still in daily use, as Anthon's many books no longer were. The result was an excellent article that is a standard reference on the topic. 2 For several decades, however, Sypher collected material on Anthon, and this book is the result. It is welcome not only as the only full account of Anthon's life and work, but because it is thoroughly researched and well written. It is to be hoped that its publication in a facsimile and reprint series will not prevent it being discovered and read, especially as it is very well designed, with an elegant layout complemented by Van Dijck type. 
Chapter 1, 'Detroit and New York', recounts Anthon's family history. His father was a doctor of German birth who married a Frenchwoman in Detroit before moving to New York in 1787. Anthon was born there in 1797, baptised as 'Carl'; he matriculated at Columbia College (as it then was) in 1811, graduating at the top of his class in 1815. Chapter 2 deals with Anthon's brief career in law, in his brother's law office, before he was appointed to a junior professorship in Classics at Columbia in 1820. In Chapter 3 we have a nicely detailed account of Anthon's long reign (1828-64) as headmaster of the College's grammar school, a post he combined from 1830 with the Jay professorship of Greek and Latin (from 1837 of Greek alone) at the College itself. The stern figure depicted in the frontispiece portrait shows why Anthon early acquired the nickname 'Bull', though this later mellowed into 'Pop'. Anthon's professorship is explored in Chapter 4, which gives details of his teaching, stressing the extensive use of short excerpts from ancient texts, a common practice at a time when grammar, syntax and metre were seen as more important than literary value. 
In Chapter 5 we are given a substantial account of Anthon's publications. He brought out an edition of Potter's Archaeologia Graeca in 1818 and of Lemprière's Classical Dictionary in 1825; further editions of Lemprière followed, some in collaboration with another prolific book-maker, the British scholar E. H. Barker. 'Anthon's Classical Dictionary' led the field in the US for several decades, though in a period when international copyright did not exist, he also produced pirated versions of the British scholar William Smith's well-known classical dictionaries. Extensive copying from other scholars, usually from German authors, was common in the nineteenth century, but Anthon ran into strong criticism from Britain in the 1840s over his use of material from the Penny Cyclopedia . He was also the subject of attacks from Boston, part of a long-standing cultural rivalry between Bostonians and New Yorkers. Sypher discusses the controversy in useful detail (pp.81-94). In some ways Anthon's most remarkable book was his vast edition of Horace (1830), more than 1,000 pages long, based on Doering's German edition, though it had few reviews, and Anthon quickly produced cut-down versions that sold much better. Its encyclopedic ambitions, reminiscent of Anthon's revision of Lemprière, were displayed in the lengthy title, which promised 'notis… ad aestheticen, historiam, geographiam, mythologiam, archaeologiam, remque botanicam, spectantibus'. Some of his later editions of classical authors were also substantial productions: the Aeneid of 1843 was over 900 pages long, as was an edition of Iliad I-VI, which included two versions of the text, one with the digamma and one without. 
Chapter 6 discusses Anthon's correspondents, including E. H. Barker and the German editor of Virgil, Philipp Wagner. Also dealt with is Anthon's involvement in 1828 in the authentication (or otherwise) of the 'golden tablets' allegedly inscribed by Joseph Smith, the founder of Mormonism. The confusion surrounding this episode, extensively written up by Mormons and their critics, is exacerbated by the fact that the two accounts given by Anthon himself are contradictory. The chapter closes with an account of Anthon's library, which after his death went to Cornell University, which outbid Anthon's own university; it thus joined the library of Franz Bopp rather than that of Lorenzo da Ponte. 
Chapter 7 deals with Anthon's private life. Sypher points out that Anthon had hardly any social life, and that this was not surprising, given his prolific book-making and his two occupations as headmaster of the grammar school and Columbia professor. Apart from a trip to a family home in Detroit in 1826, Anthon never travelled, apart from what his pupil, successor and memorialist Henry Drisler called his 'annual migration'; he spent the winter in his library on the ground floor of his home, moving to a higher floor for the summer. His home was shared with his two sisters and a disabled brother, all like him unmarried, whom he supported till his death. 
The book ends with two appendices, the first reprinting a memoir of Anthon by an ex-pupil, the second tracing the history of the portrait of Anthon that inspired Sypher to write about him. An annotated bibliography includes Anthon's own works, British versions, reviews of his books and works about him. 
This book is clearly a labour of love, assembled by an experienced historian with a strong sense of place and tradition. It has a lot to say not just about Anthon, but also about the Columbia and the New York of the nineteenth century. Its strong local focus helps to explain the lack of wider comparative analysis. Sypher compares Anthon with his own teacher Gilbert Highet, another prolific populariser, though one who unlike Anthon produced high-level scholarly works. Looking further afield, one can find other scholars to compare to Anthon: most notably, William Smith and Thomas Key. Both were associated, as Anthon was, with a metropolitan university that included a school. Like Anthon, Key held a chair, in his case at the University of London, while also being headmaster of the University's junior department (later University College School). Smith, a pupil at the school, was like Anthon an indefatigable author and editor of a series published under his name, by John Murray of London, as Anthon's was by Harper and Brothers of New York. 
The other area where more context would have been welcome is the location of Anthon's work within nineteenth-century American scholarship. Sypher mentions that Anthon brought the results of German scholarship to the US through his books, but there were others who did the same at a higher level; in particular, George Bancroft, Edward Everett and Cornelius Felton. In the second quarter of the century, they and a few other men promoted a study of Hellenism inspired by German Wissenschaft, which most of them had absorbed in Germany itself, as Anthon himself never did. This movement has been very well described by Caroline Winterer. 3 These reservations aside, Sypher places Anthon firmly and effectively in a number of contexts. In her own book, Winterer was able to refer only to a four-page article on Anthon; in future, Sypher's book will be the standard resource. Notes:

-=-=-TEXT: Freenews - Edition Nationale , Iliad 
Avec plus de 420 000 nouveaux abonnés mobiles sur le 1er trimestre 2015, le groupe Iliad (Free) continue d’afficher d’excellents résultats. 
Dernier à publier ses résultats trimestriels, juste après NC-SFR et Bouygues Telecom , Free présente un bilan toujours sans réelle faille. Un recrutement sans relâche 
Sur le mobile, il reste meilleur recruteur pour le 13è mois consécutif, avec 420 000 nouveaux clients, nets de résiliations, soit un parc total de 10,52 millions d’abonnés mobiles. 
Sur le fixe (haut et très haut débit), l’opérateur parvient à attirer 77 000 nouveaux abonnés nets, ce qui le place toujours derrière Bouygues (+96 000) mais légèrement devant Orange (+75 000), tandis que Numericable-SFR essuie une douloureuse hémorragie (-57 000). L’impact de la nouvelle Freebox Mini 4K dans ces chiffres est inconnu, mais étant donné sa date de sortie, tardive dans le trimestre, il est probable qu’il soit anecdotique. Le flou sur la fibre 
Dans le détail, le groupe revendique désormais plus de 700 000 abonnés en très haut débit. Hélas, ce chiffre tient à la fois compte des abonnements FTTH (fibre optique) et des abonnements VDSL2 dont le débit est supérieur à 30 Mbps. Il reste donc difficile de jauger les progrès de Free sur la fibre. Un chiffre d’affaires toujours en hausse 
Le chiffre d’affaires consolidé d’Iliad s’établit à 1,075 milliard d’euros sur le trimestre, en hausse de 7% par rapport à l’an dernier. Cela s’explique essentiellement par le dynamisme de l’offre mobile, qui rapporte à elle seule 437,9 millions d’euros sur le trimestre (+ 18,5%). L’activité fixe, elle, génère des revenus stables depuis l’an passé. 
Seul l’ARPU (revenu moyen par abonné) fixe fait grise mine. À 34,70 €, il enregistre un nouveau trimestre de baisse consécutif, que Free explique principalement par la multiplication d’offres promotionnelles. Néanmoins, sur l’offre premium (Freebox Révolution), il demeure supérieur à 38 €, sans plus de précisions.

(Boursier.com) — LA TENDANCE 
Le CAC40 affiche un léger gain à la mi-journée à la Bourse de Paris, de 0,46% à 5.053 points. Il lui faudra encore accélérer pour tenter de terminer sur un bilan hebdomadaire positif après un début de semaine teinté de rouge. Vendredi dernier, l'indice parisien cotait 5.090 points à la cloche. Deux statistiques sont susceptibles d'influer sur les indices cet après-midi aux Etats-Unis. Les chiffres de la production industrielle d'avril d'abord, que les économistes attendent stable par rapport à mars, et l'indice du sentiment des consommateurs compilé par l'Université du Michigan et Reuters, anticipé à 95,9 points (stable) en mai. 
A la mi-journée, tous les grands secteurs sont en hausse en Europe, hormis le compartiment pétrolier & gazier qui souffre de la troisième séance de reflux du baril, avec de bonnes performances des financières, de la construction et des loisirs. Le STOXX 600 européen grappille 0,7% et se hisse à nouveau sur les 400 points. 
ECO ET DEVISES 
Aux Etats-Unis, l'indice 'Empire State' d'activité manufacturière de la Fed de New York (14h30 : consensus 5) précèdera la production industrielle américaine d'avril (15h15 : consensus +0,0% m/m) et l'indice du sentiment des consommateurs américains de l'Université du Michigan et Reuters (16h00 : consensus 95,9). Aucune statistique d'envergure n'est programmée en Europe. 
La parité euro / dollar atteint 1,1361 ce matin. Le baril de Brent se négocie 66,52$ et le WTI 59,50$ pour l'échéance de juin. L'once d'or se traite 1.219$ (-0,25%). 
VALEURS EN HAUSSE 
* Lexibook (+35% à 3,05 euros) : grosse envolée spéculative pour le dossier, dopé par la publication du chiffre d'affaires du dernier trimestre 2014-2015, en nette amélioration. Il ne s'agit pas vraiment d'une prouesse dans la mesure où les revenus étaient négatifs un an plus tôt sur la période, à cause de nombreux retours produits après des méventes, notamment dans les tablettes. Cependant avec 5,5 ME de revenus, ce dernier trimestre 2014-2015 est meilleur que ceux des précédents exercices affichant un profil moins atypique que celui de 2013-2014 (2,5 ME en 2012-2013, 1,4 ME en 2011-2012 et 2,9 ME en 2010-2011). 
* Avanquest (+30% à 0,26 euro) : la société est en situation précaire, avec une énorme augmentation de capital en cours sur laquelle elle joue sa survie. Mais ses revenus sur neuf mois sont intéressants, avec une croissance à deux chiffres. Là encore, le dossier très spéculatif fait le bonheur des traders. 
* Thales (+2,4% à 55,63 euros) : belle progression, soutenue par la recommandation "surpondérer" de Barclays, qui a relevé de 52 à 60 euros sa valorisation. 
* ArcelorMittal (+2% à 10,5 euros) : l'aciériste poursuit sur sa lancée de la veille, 5% de hausse, après la décision de la Commission européenne de durcir son action antidumping en lançant une enquête sur la Chine et la Russie. BofA ML est par ailleurs passé de "neutre" à "acheter" sur le dossier. 
* SIPH (+1,6% à 37,86 euros) : le groupe a publié des chiffres en berne au premier trimestre, mais entrevoit l'embellie sur les prochains mois. 
* Iliad (+1,2% à 219,5 euros) : le groupe a démarré le millésime 2015 sur un chiffre d'affaires en hausse de 7% et des recrutements en progression, même si le rythme de hausse dans le fixe est faible dans un marché mature. L'opérateur confirme viser une croissance de son EBITDA supérieure à 10%.

Une tendance que confirme Société Générale qui précise que le groupe a fait mieux que ses concurrents Orange, Bouygues Telecom et surtout SFR qui a enregistré une baisse de son nombre d'abonnés au premier trimestre.La branche mobile d'Iliad a également bénéficié de la hausse de 23% des revenus des services grâce à l'amélioration du mix abonnés et aux migrations des abonnés au Forfait 2 euros vers le Forfait Free à 19,99 euros par mois.Le grand succès remporté par les offres mobiles de Free permet de compenser la performance moyenne de la division fixe. Cette dernière a vu ses revenus progresser de 0,3% à 639,7 millions d'euros. Là encore, l'opérateur télécom est parvenu à attirer 77 000 nouveaux abonnés haut débit, une accélération par rapport au quatrième trimestre 2014 où 63 000 personnes avaient choisi un abonnement fixe de Free. Iliad assure avoir réalisé, à lui seul, 42% des recrutements nets de clients dans le fixe au premier trimestre.Au terme de cette publication du premier trimestre, Iliad a confirmé son objectif d'une croissance de l'Ebitda supérieure à 10% en 2015.

A 12H02, l'indice CAC 40 prenait 29,64 points à 5058,95 points, dans un volume d'échanges de 1,5 milliard d'euros. La veille, il avait progressé de 1,36% à l'occasion d'un jour férié en France, rompant avec trois séances de baisse consécutives."La croissance américaine inquiète les investisseurs et les publications de statistiques attendues dans l'après-midi outre-Atlantique seront observées de près", soulignent dans une note les analystes de Saxo Banque. Au menu figurent notamment l'activité industrielle dans la région de New York en mai, la production industrielle d'avril et la première estimation de la confiance des consommateurs en mai par l'Université de Michigan."Les statistiques américaines de production industrielle et de confiance des consommateurs seront d'autant plus importantes aujourd'hui qu'elles feront suite à celle des ventes au détail qui se sont avérées décevantes", soulignent de leur côté les stratégistes de Crédit Mutuel-CIC."Elles conditionneront un éventuel rééquilibrage des attentes en termes de politique monétaire de la Fed", ajoutent-ils. Les investisseurs sont toujours à l'affût d'indices pouvant leur permettre d'y voir plus clair sur le calendrier que pourrait adopter la banque centrale américaine (Fed) pour remonter ses taux directeurs. Enfin, les préoccupations sur l'avancée des négociations entre la Grèce et ses créanciers restent en toile de fond, alors que la première estimation du PIB au premier trimestre est attendue. Le gouvernement grec, en quête urgente d'un accord avec ses créanciers pour toucher une tranche de prêts vitale, souhaite mettre cette question au menu d'un sommet européen prévu à Riga la semaine prochaine, normalement consacréà l'Europe orientale."Les tensions restent vives entre le gouvernement grec et les autorités européennes sans espoir de compromis à court terme", note Crédit Mutuel-CIC. Du côté des valeurs, Iliad grimpait de 0,90% à 218,90 euros, profitant de la publication d'un chiffre d'affaires en hausse de 7% au premier trimestre à 1,075 milliard d'euros. Le secteur bancaire contribuait à la bonne tenue du marché avec Société Générale (+1,40% à 45,56 euros), BNP Paribas (+1,53% à 57,77 euros) et Crédit Agricole (+0,73% à 14,42 euros). Le secteur automobile, sensible à la conjoncture, était lui aussi bien orienté: Renault gagnait 1,50% à 92,68 euros, Valeo 1,45% à 150,40 euros et Peugeot 1,33% à 17,47 euros. Les valeurs pétrolières et parapétrolières étaient quant à elles à la traîne, plombées par un repli des cours du brut. Total perdait 0,83% à 46,94 euros, Technip 1,21% à 62,20 euros, CGG 1,34% à 6,83 euros, Maurel et Prom 0,61% à 8,01 euros. afp/rp

Load More Several mobile operators plan to block advertising on their networks, setting the stage for a battle with digital media companies such as Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL) , AOL and Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO) .
One European wireless carrier told the Financial Times that it has installed blocking software in its data centres and planned to turn it on before the end of 2015.
The software prevents most types of advertising from loading in web pages and apps, though it does not interfere with "in-feed" ads of the kind used by Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) .
The blocking technology was developed by Shine, an Israeli start-up whose shareholders include Horizon Ventures, the investment fund of Li Ka-shing, Asia's richest person.
Mr Li also controls Hutchison Whampoa (Hong Kong Stock Exchange: 13-HK) , one of the world's largest telecoms groups.
"Tens of millions of mobile subscribers around the world will be opting in to ad blocking by the end of the year," said Roi Carthy, chief marketing officer of Shine. "If this scales, it could have a devastating impact on the online advertising industry."
Verizon (NYSE: VZ) , the largest US telecoms group, this week paid $4.4bn to buy AOL , seeking to gain a foothold in the rapidly growing market for advertising on mobile devices.
Marketers will spend almost $69 billion this year on mobile ads - more than triple the sum they spent two years ago - according to research group eMarketer.
Shine said it was working with a number of operators, including one with almost 40 million subscribers, though it declined to name them.
An executive at a European carrier confirmed that it and several of its peers are planning to start blocking adverts this year.
The executive said that the carrier will initially launch an advertising-free service for customers on an opt-in basis.
But it is also considering a more radical idea that it calls "the bomb", which would apply across its entire network of millions of subscribers at once. The idea is to specifically target Google, blocking advertising on its websites in an attempt to force the company into giving up a cut of its revenues.
View gallery Several mobile operators plan to block advertising on their networks, setting the stage for a battle … The Silicon Valley company is the world's largest advertising business, generating $60 billion a year from search, YouTube, and services such as Google Display Network and DoubleClick, which both deliver ads for third-party sites.
The executive at the mobile operator considering "the bomb" acknowledged that targeting Google could be risky from both a legal and public relations perspective. Under "net neutrality" rules in the European Union and the US, telecoms companies are forced to treat all data that flow through their networks equally.
But even within those markets, it would be feasible to block adverts on Google "just for an hour or a day" to bring the company to the negotiating table, the executive said.
More from the Financial Times:
Online arms race heats up over adverts
Screens collide in clash over advertising
Verizon looks to AOL for mobile ads edge
Many mobile operators are frustrated that digital media companies profit from their high-speed networks without having to invest in the infrastructure behind them. Such irritation was inflamed last month when Google launched Project Fi, its own wireless carrier in the US.
Google said it would be unreasonable for mobile operators to block ads, arguing that: "People pay for mobile internet packages so they can access the apps, video streaming, webmail and other services they love, many of which are funded by ads. Google and other web companies invest heavily in developing these services - and in the behind-the-scenes infrastructure to deliver them."
Blocking advertising on mobile networks is likely to provoke a fierce backlash from digital media companies. In 2013, Free, the French internet service provider owned by Iliad, blocked ads by default through its Freebox modem, causing huge controversy. It was forced to scrap the initiative within a week under pressure from the Socialist government.
Mr Carthy of Shine said that eliminating intrusive adverts is a "consumer right", even if it undermines the business model of online publishers that rely on advertising.
"Online advertising is out of control and it's polluting the user experience," he said. Pop-ups, auto-playing videos and other forms of digital advertising can consume between 10 and 50 per cent of a mobile subscriber's data plan, he added.
While ad-blocking is a new phenomenon on mobiles, it is more established on PCs and growing quickly. More than 140m people, or 5 per cent of the online population, use software such as Adblock Plus to eliminate adverts when browsing the web on laptops or desktop computers.
As the Financial Times reported in February, Google, Microsoft and Amazon have paid the makers of Adblock Plus to allow some ads on their sites to slip through its filters.
Google's relationship with ad-blocking is further complicated by the fact that such software is the most popular type of free add-on to Chrome, its popular web browser.

"On a une dynamique de recrutement sur le trimestre qui est très bonne avec 420 000 nouveaux abonnés" pour le mobile, a souligné Maxime Lombardini, directeur général de Free à l'AFP. Selon le groupe, la part de marché de Free sur ce secteur s'élève à 15%. 
L'offre à bas coût de Free continue à séduire et les consommateurs sont aussi attirés par l'élargissement de l'itinérance gratuite à internationale, attractive à l'approche des vacances, relève encore le directeur général, avant de souligner que "la dynamique commerciale est trè Des concurrents moins en forme 
Iliad clôt ainsi la publication des résultats du premier trimestre des opérateurs télécoms français, qui ont montré des performances contrastées.

Ce dernier a perdu quelque 400 000 clients mobiles particuliers pour atteindre 15,8 millions, une hémorragie dont ont su profiter les concurrents. 
Orange a quasi stabilisé son chiffre d'affaires au premier trimestre (-1,4% à 9,67 milliards d'euros), tandis que Bouygues Telecom a affiché une activité en recul de 2% à 1,063 milliard d'euros.

-=-=-TEXT: Deel De Europese aandelenbeurzen wisten vrijdagochtend de winsten van een dag eerder verder uit te breiden. De stabilisering van de rentes op de obligatiemarkten en een nieuw slotrecord van de Amerikaanse S&P 500-index zorgden voor optimisme onder beleggers. 
''De beurzen gaan in lijn met Wall Street verder omhoog en de Griekse problemen worden weer even aan de kant geschoven. Het is verder een relatief rustige beursdag. De beursvolumes zijn laag en het is vooral wachten op wat de markt volgende week gaat doen", aldus handelaar Cees Smit van Today's Beheer. 
De AEX-index in Amsterdam noteerde aan het einde van de ochtend 1 procent hoger op 495,41 punten. De MidKap steeg 0,5 procent tot 763,79 punten. De beurzen in Londen, Parijs en Frankfurt kregen er 0,4 tot 0,7 procent bij. 
Grootste stijger in de AEX was ArcelorMittal met een winst van 2,7 procent, na een adviesverhoging door Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Het staalbedrijf won een dag eerder al bijna 6 procent, nadat Brussel aankondigde een onderzoek te starten naar het vermeende dumpen van staalproducten door China en Rusland. Shell 
Olieconcern Shell en tankopslagbedrijf Vopak waren de enige dalers met verliezen van 0,3 procent. 
In de MidKap ging bouwbedrijf BAM aan kop met een plus van bijna 4 procent. Grootste daler was biotechnologiebedrijf Galapagos met een min van meer dan 4 procent. Beleggers namen wat winst na de koersstijging van ruim 14 procent op donderdag. 
Op de lokale markt maakte Inverko een koerssprong van 6,5 procent. Het recyclingbedrijf verwacht dat de omzet in de komende kwartalen zal herstellen en aantrekken. Roche 
Roche won meer dan 3 procent in Zürich. De Zwitserse farmaceut maakte positieve testresultaten van een aantal kandidaatmedicijnen bekend. In Parijs klom Iliad 1 procent, na een positief kwartaalbericht van de Franse telecomgroep.

0,42% (CercleFinance.com) - La Bourse de Paris affiche de légers gains vendredi matin, poursuivant son rebond de la veille, dans un contexte favorable de reflux de l'euro et de tassement des rendements obligataires.Vers 10h20, l'indice CAC 40 progresse de 0,5% à 5053,5 points dans un volume réduit de 540 millions d'euros du fait du pont de l'Ascension.Ailleurs en Europe, Londres s'adjuge 0,3% et Francfort gagne 0,2%.

0,94% (CercleFinance.com) - Espirito Santo a renouvelé vendredi son opinion 'neutre' et sa 'valeur intrinsèque' (fair value) de 212 euros sur Iliad après la présentation des chiffres d'activité de premier trimestre du groupe de télécommunications.Le broker note que le chiffre d'affaires a progressé de 7% pour atteindre 1.075 millions d'euros, une performance légèrement inférieure à son objectif de 1.093 millions.'Le principal moteur de la croissance de l'activité reste le segment mobile dans lequel le chiffre d'affaires a grimpé de 18,5% à 437,9 millions d'euros, un peu en dessous de notre prévision de 446 millions', note ES.Le courtier met pourtant en évidence l'arrivée de 420.000 nouveaux abonnés mobiles sur le trimestre, là où il n'anticipait que 350.000 nouveaux clients.A 639,7 millions d'euros, le chiffre d'affaires du fixe ressort lui en-dessous de sa prévision de 646 millions, malgré une bonne dynamique commerciale avec l'ajout de 77.000 nouveaux abonnés haut débit fixe sur le trimestre.Le broker note qu'Iliad a confirmé son objectif d'une croissance de l'Ebitda supérieure à 10% en 2015, mais regrette que l'opérateur ne fournisse pas d'objectifs trimestriels.Copyright © 2015 CercleFinance.com.

Le trublion des télécoms, fondé par Xavier Niel, a publié vendredi un chiffre d'affaires consolidé de 1,075 milliard d'euros pour les trois premiers mois de l'année. Le mobile en forte hausse

"On a une dynamique de recrutement sur le trimestre qui est très bonne avec 420 000 nouveaux abonnés" pour le mobile, a souligné Maxime Lombardini, directeur général de Free à l'AFP. Selon le groupe, la part de marché de Free sur ce secteur s'élève à 15%. 
L'offre à bas coût de Free continue à séduire et les consommateurs sont aussi attirés par l'élargissement de l'itinérance gratuite à internationale, attractive à l'approche des vacances, relève encore le directeur général, avant de souligner que "la dynamique commerciale est trè Des concurrents moins en forme 
Iliad clôt ainsi la publication des résultats du premier trimestre des opérateurs télécoms français, qui ont montré des performances contrastées.

Ce dernier a perdu quelque 400 000 clients mobiles particuliers pour atteindre 15,8 millions, une hémorragie dont ont su profiter les concurrents. 
Orange a quasi stabilisé son chiffre d'affaires au premier trimestre (-1,4% à 9,67 milliards d'euros), tandis que Bouygues Telecom a affiché une activité en recul de 2% à 1,063 milliard d'euros. 
Le chiffre d'affaires de Numericable-SFR s'est lui replié de 4,6% à 2,740 milliards d'euros, mais son retour à la rentabilité sur le trimestre a été salué par le marché

De aandelenbeurs in Amsterdam is vrijdagochtend licht hoger geopend. Ook de andere Europese effectenmarkten begonnen met kleine winsten, in navolging van het nieuwe slotrecord van de Amerikaanse S&P 500-index. De blik is onder meer gericht op de Verenigde Staten, waar later op de dag cijfers over de industriële productie en het consumentenvertrouwen op het programma staan. 
De AEX-index in Amsterdam noteerde in de vroege handel 0,7 procent hoger op 493,98 punten. De MidKap steeg 0,2 procent tot 761,78 punten. De beurzen in Londen, Parijs en Frankfurt kregen er tot 0,4 procent bij. 
ArcelorMittal Grootste stijger in de AEX was ArcelorMittal met een winst van meer dan 2 procent, na een adviesverhoging door Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Het staalbedrijf won een dag eerder al bijna 6 procent, nadat Brussel aankondigde een onderzoek te starten naar het vermeende dumpen van staalproducten door China en Rusland. Olieconcern Shell sloot de rij met een verlies van 0,3 procent. 
Besi In de MidKap profiteerde toeleverancier aan de chipindustrie Besi (plus 1,7 procent) van een adviesverhoging door Kepler Cheuvreux. Grootste daler was biotechnologiebedrijf Galapagos met een min van 3,8 procent. Beleggers namen wat winst na de koersstijging van ruim 14 procent op donderdag. 
Inverko Op de lokale markt maakte Inverko een koerssprong van 8,6 procent, na publicatie van een kwartaalbericht. Het recyclingbedrijf, dat in het afgelopen kwartaal nog worstelde met de financiële herstructurering van onderdeel Inverko Polymers, verwacht dat de omzet in de komende kwartalen zal herstellen en aantrekken. 
In Parijs klom Iliad 1 procent. De Franse telecomgroep zag de omzet in het eerste kwartaal toenemen dankzij een sterke groei in de activiteiten op het gebied van mobiele telefonie. 
De euro noteerde vrijdagochtend op 1,1387 dollar, tegen 1,1359 dollar bij het slot van de Europese beurshandel op donderdag. De prijs van een vat Amerikaanse olie zakte 0,5 procent naar 59,58 dollar. Brentolie daalde 0,4 procent in prijs tot 66,45 dollar per vat. Aanmelden nieuwsbrief

Tout va bien pour Free, plus de trois ans après son arrivée en fanfare dans le petit monde des télécoms français. La firme de Xavier Niel, Iliad, maison-mère de Free, vient de dévoiler des résultats trimestriels très positifs, pour ce début d'année 2015. Entre janvier et mars de cette année, Free Mobile a recruté 420 000 nouveaux clients, pour atteindre 10,525 millions d'abonnés, soit 15 % de parts de marché. Selon le communiqué de la compagnie, Free reste d'ailleurs le " leader en recrutement d’abonnés pour le 13ème trimestre consécutif ". 
Pour expliquer cette hausse, Free met deux points en avant, avec l’enrichissement de son offre et le développement de son réseau 4G, avec plus de 950 nouvelles antennes déployées sur cette période. Le chiffre d’affaires de la division mobile a logiquement augmenté dans les mêmes proportion, avec 437,9 millions d'euros au total, soit une hausse de 18,5 % par rapport à la même période l'an dernier. Comme le rapporte Capital, ces bonnes nouvelles ont évidemment reçu un accueil très positif à la bourse de Paris, " à 9h20, le titre prenait 1,22%, à 219,6 euros, valorisant la sociétéà plus de 12,8 milliards d’euros ."

-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: Reprint 
Iliad reported a 7 per cent increase in revenue for the first quarter of 2015 due to strong mobile sales, and confirmed its target of achieving more than 10 per cent group EBITDA growth for the year as a whole. 
The France-based company, which first launched its Free Mobile unit in January 2012, said revenue from the sale of mobile products and services rose by 18.5 per cent to €437.9 million ($497 million), with services revenue alone rising as much as 23 per cent. This compares to a negligible 0.3 per cent growth in the landline business. Consolidated group revenue reached almost €1.1 billion. 
The number of mobile users increased by 420,000 in the quarter, taking the mobile user base to 10.5 million and representing a market share of more than 15 per cent. The total number of fixed and mobile users reached 16.5 million. 
Iliad attributed the strong performance of its mobile business to its competitive pricing strategy, which has enabled Free Mobile to maintain strong sales momentum over 13 quarters. The company now allows subscribers to its fixed Freebox service to take out up to four Free Mobile plans at €15.99 a month, instead of the usual price of €19.99. 
The company also still offers an entry-level plan for €2 a month or zero for existing subscribers, but reported a healthy rate of user migration to the €19.99 plan. 
Although Free Mobile lacks the more sophisticated mobile offerings of rivals Orange, Bouygues Telecom and Numericable-SFR--which provide services such as free content and multi-SIM plans that allow data to be shared between a smartphone and a tablet--it remains a tough act to follow in terms of its low-cost pricing. 
The company is now focusing on expanding its 3G and 4G networks. It said it deployed more than 950 new 4G sites in the first quarter of 2015 compared with 400 in the same period a year ago. Its target is to cover 60 per cent of France's population with 4G by the end of 2015. 
In April, Free Mobile also said its 3G network now covers 78 per cent of France's population; it aims to cover 90 per cent by January 2018. By that point, a national roaming agreement with Orange for 2G and 3G services is also due to expire.

-=-=-TEXT: Tweet Bourse Paris: le CAC 40 en léger repli (-0,21%) après l'ouverture de Wall Street Paris (awp/afp) - La Bourse de Paris évoluait en léger repli (-0,21%) vendredi après les débuts en légère hausse de Wall Street, son élan de la matinée ayant été rogné par un indicateur américain décevant. A 15H42, l'indice CAC 40 perdait 10,52 points à 5018,79 points, dans un volume d'échanges de 2,4 milliards d'euros. La veille, il avait progressé de 1,36% à l'occasion d'un jour férié en France, rompant avec trois séances de baisse consécutives. Au lendemain de ce net rebond, la cote parisienne a de nouveau ouvert du bon pied vendredi et a réussi à s'y maintenir jusqu'à la publication d'un nouveau recul décevant de la production industrielle aux États-Unis en avril."La production industrielle américaine baisse maintenant pour le 5e mois de suite, ce qui ne constitue pas un environnement favorable à une remontée des taux directeurs de la Fed", a observé James Knightley, un économiste du bancassureur ING."Après des ventes de détails (en avril) fragiles, les espoirs d'observer un rebond décent de la croissance américaine au 2e trimestre après un premier trimestre difficile commencent à s'évaporer", a-t-il ajouté. L'activité industrielle dans la région de New York a pour sa part connu une légère hausse en mai de 4 points (contre 4,5 attendues par le consensus des analystes). Les investisseurs attendaient encore par ailleurs les chiffres de la confiance des consommateurs en mai par l'Université de Michigan. Enfin, les préoccupations sur l'avancée des négociations entre la Grèce et ses créanciers restaient en toile de fond, alors que la première estimation du PIB au premier trimestre est attendue. Le gouvernement grec, en quête urgente d'un accord avec ses créanciers pour toucher une tranche de prêts vitale, souhaite mettre cette question au menu d'un sommet européen prévu à Riga la semaine prochaine, normalement consacréà l'Europe orientale."Même si la Grèce semble faire preuve de bonne volonté concernant les réformes, les ministres européens des finances attendent plus et continue donc de maintenir la pression sur Athènes", alors que "les investisseurs espèrent un accord avant la fin du mois", ont noté les analystes de Saxo Banque. Du côté des valeurs, Iliad grimpait de 0,83% à 218,75 euros, profitant de la publication d'un chiffre d'affaires en hausse de 7% au premier trimestre à 1,075 milliard d'euros. Le secteur automobile était aussi bien orienté: Renault gagnait 0,84% à 92,08 euros, Valeo 1,08% à 149,80 euros et Peugeot 0,61% à 17,34 euros. Les valeurs pétrolières et parapétrolières étaient quant à elles à la traîne, plombées par un repli des cours du brut. Total perdait 1,95% à 46,41 euros, Technip 3,32% à 60,87 euros et CGG 2,12% à 6,78 euros. afp/rp

-=-=-TEXT: "Armenpress" introduces bestseller books list 3/12 10:00, 15 May, 2015 
YEREVAN, MAY 15, ARMENPRESS. “The Daredevils of Sassoun” tops this week's "Bestseller Books List" introduced by "Armenpress" News Agency. The Armenian epic poem is introduced in different dialects with parallel French translation by Aida Charkhchyan. 
In the initial decades following the discovery of the epic in the late nineteenth century a general consensus emerged attributing its theme to the struggle of four generations of Sassoun's warriors against Arab rule in the 8th to 10th centuries. The pioneers of this interpretation of the epic were the philologist Manoug Abeghyan in Armenia and academician Hovsep Orbeli in Leningrad who argued that there are no characters in the epic who could be attributed to a historical figure before the 10th century. 
This historicist school held its sway until the Armenian philologist Grigoryan first in an article (1981), then in a book (1989) argued following an incisive analysis of the epic, "it is indisputable that the roots of the epic go back deep into the centuries, and they reach not only the cuneiform times when monarchy was underway in Armenia, but even the prehistoric era." Grigoryan identified various episodes in the epic as of patently matriarchal origin, prompting various scholars both in Soviet Armenia and elsewhere to probe deeper into the proto-layers of the epic. 
The Daredevils of Sassoun is commonly cited as one of the most important works of Armenian folklore. This recital of the legendary deeds of four generations of strongmen in a warrior community in the Armenian highlands is in the tradition of heroic folktales that dramatize the story of a whole nation and voice its deepest sentiments and aspirations, but unlike such well-known epics as the Iliad and the Odyssey (Greek), Epic of Gilgamesh (Sumerian), Beowulf (English), Chanson de Roland (French), Cantar de Mio Cid (Spanish) and others one might mention, it has survived solely by word of mouth, transmitted from one generation to another by village bards. The literary merits of the Sasun saga surpass its value as a historical or linguistic document. 
The performance of the Daredevils of Sassoun is included in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage representative list in 2012. 
“The Book of Lamentations; Hymns'' by St. Gregory of Narek published by “Zangak” publishing house occupies the second position of the list. The mystical poem "Book of Lamentations" has been translated into many languages and has played a significant role in the development of the Armenian literary language. In 95 grace-filled prayers St. Gregory draws on the exquisite potential of the Classical Armenian language to translate the pure sighs of the broken and contrite heart into an offering of words pleasing to God. The result is an edifice of faith for the ages, unique in Christian literature for its rich imagery, its subtle theology, its Biblical erudition, and the sincere immediacy of its communication with God. This masterpiece by St. Gregory of Narek has always been included in our bestseller books list. 
"The Little Prince" by French author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry published by Edit Print and Antares publishing houses occupy the third and fourth places respectively. The novella is both the most read and most translated book in the French language, and was voted the best book of the 20th century in France. The book was translated into more than 250 languages and dialects, as well as Braille. 
Saint-Exupéry, a laureate of several of France's highest literary awards and a reserve military pilot at the start of the Second World War, wrote and illustrated the manuscript while exiled in the United States after the Fall of France. He had travelled there on a personal mission to persuade its government to quickly enter the war against Nazi Germany. In the midst of personal upheavals and failing health he produced almost half of the writings he would be remembered for, including a tender tale of loneliness, friendship, love and loss, in the form of a young prince fallen to Earth. 
The Sandcastle Girls by Chris Bohjalian occupies the fifth place. Over the course of his career, New York Times bestselling novelist Chris Bohjalian has taken readers on a spectacular array of journeys. Midwives brought us to an isolated Vermont farmhouse on an icy winter’s night and a homebirth gone tragically wrong. The Double Bind perfectly conjured the Roaring Twenties on Long Island – and a young social worker’s descent into madness. And Skeletons at the Feast chronicled the last six months of World War Two in Poland and Germany with nail-biting authenticity. As The Washington Post Book World has written, Bohjalian writes “the sorts of books people stay awake all night to finish." 
In his fifteenth book, The Sandcastle Girls, he brings us on a very different kind of journey. This spellbinding tale travels between Aleppo, Syria in 1915 and Bronxville, New York in 2012—a sweeping historical love story steeped in the author's Armenian heritage, making it his most personal novel to date. 
When Elizabeth Endicott arrives in Syria she has a diploma from Mount Holyoke College, a crash course in nursing, and only the most basic grasp of the Armenian language. The First World War is spreading across Europe and she has volunteered on behalf of the Boston-based Friends of Armenia to deliver food and medical aid to refugees of the Armenian Genocide. There Elizabeth becomes friendly with Armen, a young Armenian engineer who has already lost his wife and infant daughter. When Armen leaves Aleppo to join the British army in Egypt, he begins to write Elizabeth letters, and comes to realize that he has fallen in love with the wealthy, young American woman who is so different from the wife he lost. 
Flash forward to the present, where we meet Laura Petrosian, a novelist living in suburban New York. Although her grandparents' ornate Pelham home was affectionately nicknamed "The Ottoman Annex," Laura has never really given her Armenian heritage much thought. But when an old friend calls, claiming to have seen a newspaper photo of Laura's grandmother promoting an exhibit at a Boston museum, Laura embarks on a journey back through her family's history that reveals love, loss – and a wrenching secret that has been buried for generations. 
“The Book of Lamentations; Hymns'' by St. Gregory of Narek this time published by “Nahapet” publishing house occupies the sixth position. 
“Mother” by Henri Verneuil occupies the seventh place. Henri Verneuil was born on October 15, 1920 in Rodosto, Turkey as Achod Malakian. He was a director and writer, known for The Sicilian Clan (1969), The Night Caller (1975) and I as in Icarus (1979). He died on January 11, 2002 in Bagnolet, Seine-Saint-Denis, France. It was at the tender age of 4 that Achod Malakian arrived with his family in Marseille, joining thousands of Armenians in fleeing the Turkish government's massacres of their people. As Henri Verneuil, at the end of his life, he devoted his two final full-length features to this part of his childhood and heritage. 
Born in Turkey and was a naturalized French citizen of Armenian ancestry. Former journalist, editor, film critic and radio commentator. Directed his first short film in 1946, his first motion picture six years later. Best known for his popular thrillers and action films, frequently starring Jean Gabin. 
"1984" by George Orwell occupies the eighth position of the Bestseller Books List introduced by "Armenpress" News Agency. While 1984 has come and gone, Orwell's narrative is more timely that ever. 1984 presents a "negative utopia", that is at once a startling and haunting vision of the world — so powerful that it's completely convincing from start to finish. No one can deny the power of this novel, its hold on the imaginations of entire generations of readers, or the resiliency of its admonitions — a legacy that seems to grow, not lessen, with the passage of time. 
Another book by the same author, "Animal Farm" occupies the ninth position of our list. Animal Farm is an allegorical and dystopian novel, published in Englandon 17 August 1945. According to Orwell, the book reflects events leading up to theRussian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalin era in the Soviet Union. Orwell, ademocratic socialist, was an outspoken critic of Joseph Stalin and, especially after experiences with the NKVD and the Spanish Civil War, he was actively opposed to the controversial ideology of Stalinism. The Soviet Union, he believed, had become a brutaldictatorship, built upon a cult of personality and enforced by a reign of terror. In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described Animal Farm as a satirical tale against Stalin "un conte satirique contre Staline", and in his essay "Why I Write" (1946), he wrote that Animal Farm was the first book in which he had tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, "to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole". 
The original title was Animal Farm: A Fairy Story, though the subtitle was dropped by U.S. publishers for its 1946 publication and subsequently all but one of the translations during Orwell's lifetime omitted it. Other variations in the title include: A Satire and A Contemporary Satire. Orwell suggested the title Union des républiques socialistes animales for the French translation, which recalled the French name of the Soviet Union,Union des républiques socialistes soviétiques, and which abbreviates to URSA, the Latinfor "bear", a symbol of Russia. 
“The Tin Drum” by Günter Grass occupies the final place of the rating list. The Tin Drum, one of the great novels of the twentieth century, was published in Ralph Manheim’s outstanding translation in 1959. It became a runaway bestseller and catapulted its young author to the forefront of world literature. 
After more than fifty years, The Tin Drum has, if anything, gained in power and relevance. All of Grass’s amazing evocations are still there, and still amazing: Oskar Matzerath, the indomitable drummer; his grandmother, Anna Koljaiczek; his mother, Agnes; Alfred Matzerath and Jan Bronski, his presumptive fathers. And Oskar’s midget friends—Bebra, the great circus master, and Roswitha Raguna, the famous somnambulist; Sister Scholastica and Sister Agatha, the Right Reverend Father Wiehnke, the Greffs, the Schefflers, Herr Fajngold, all Kashubians, Poles, Germans, and Jews—waiting to be discovered and rediscovered. 
To complete the bestseller list, the following bookshops have participated in the survey: “New Book” (093-60-40-64), “Noah’s Ark” (56-81-84), Armenian Book” (54-07-06), “Edit Print” (57-70-09), “Bureaucrat” (50-01-52), “Bookinist” (53-74-13), “Art Bridge” (58-12-84) and “Zangak” (23-25-28).

La journée avait pourtant bien commencé avec des achats techniques destinés à doper les indices d'actions en cette journée des '3 sorcières' puis le tassement des rendements obligataires (les T-Bonds revenant de 2,24 vers 2,19% puis 2,20% vers 15H45). En Europe, les Bunds et le OAT se détendent de -5Pts de base à 0,65 et 0,93% respectivement... une bonne occasion de privilégier 'le risque', donc les actions à la veille du weekend.'Evidemment, si la stabilité du compartiment obligataire se confirme, alors la stratégie des investisseurs qui consiste à racheter les points bas ('buy the dips') va continuer de fonctionner sachant que la mécanique Draghi tourne à plein', explique-t-on chez IG.Les chiffres US publiés ce vendredi gâchent un peu la fête: un nouveau record absolu pour le Dow Jones semblait presque acquis mais il plafonne vers 18.260 (+0,04%) et ne retrace pas son zénith des 18.288 du 2 mars.Le 'S&P' devait aller s'offrir un nouveau record absolu au-delà des 2.126 (c'était chose faite en préouverture ce matin) mais il 'cale' sous 2.124.Lors d'une intervention hier au siège du FMI, le président de la BCE a confirmé la volonté de l'institution d'aller jusqu'au bout de son programme d'assouplissement quantitatif (QE), ce qui tend à soutenir les marchés actions et, sur le plan monétaire, à faire recul l'euro.Mario Draghi évacue le reproche fait au 'QE' d'être un vecteur d'inégalités et juge les craintes d'instabilité financières non fondées (donc, il ne faut s'inquiéter de la récente tension des taux). Plus d'Euro à l'horizon 2016 égal un Euro moins cher: il recule de 0,65% face au dollar à 1,1340, ce qui favorise les valeurs exportatrices comme Airbus Group (+2,3%), leader de l'indice phare, Thales (+2,1%) ou encore Plastic Omnium (+2,4%).Le CAC40 est plombé par le compartiment énergie avec Technip (-3%), Total (-1,75%) puis par CapGemini (-1%) et Orange (-1,5%).Son concurrent Iliad gagne de son côté 0,8% après avoir fait état ce matin un chiffre d'affaires trimestriel en progression de 7% à près de 1,1 milliard d'euros, une performance légèrement inférieure au consensus.Il reste un chiffre à se mettre sous la dent aux USA: l'indice de la confiance des consommateurs du Michigan également pour le mois de mai.Copyright (c) 2015 CercleFinance.com.

Introduction 
On her death bed, Gertrude Stein lifted her head and asked: “What is the answer?” When no one spoke, she smiled and said: “In that case, what is the question?” —Donald Sutherland, Gertrude Stein: A Biography of Her Work 
I am curious about curiosity. 
One of the first words that we learn as a child is why. Partly because we want to know something about the mysterious world into which we have unwillingly entered, partly because we want to understand how the things in that world function, and partly because we feel an ancestral need to engage with the other inhabitants of that world, after our first babblings and cooings, we begin to ask “Why?” We never stop. Very soon we find out that curiosity is seldom rewarded with meaningful or satisfying answers, but rather with an increased desire to ask more questions and the pleasure of conversing with others. As any inquisitor knows, affirmations tend to isolate; questions bind. Curiosity is a means of declaring our allegiance to the human fold. 
Perhaps all curiosity can be summed up in Michel de Montaigne’s famous question “Que sais-je?”: “What do I know?” which appears in the second book of his Essays . Speaking of the skeptic philosophers, Montaigne remarked that they were unable to express their general ideas in any manner of speech, because, according to him, “they would have needed a new language.” “Our language,” says Montaigne, “is formed of affirmative propositions, which are contrary to their thinking.” And then he adds: “This fantasy is better conceived through the question ‘What do I know?,’ which I carry as a motto on a shield.” The source of the question is, of course, the Socratic “Know thyself,” but in Montaigne it becomes not an existentialist assertion of the need to know who we are but rather a continuous state of questioning of the territory through which our mind is advancing (or has already advanced) and of the uncharted country ahead. In the realm of Montaigne’s thought, the affirmative propositions of language turn on themselves and become questions. 
My friendship with Montaigne dates back to my adolescence, and his Essays have since been for me a kind of autobiography, as I keep finding in his comments my own preoccupations and experiences translated into luminous prose. Through his questioning of commonplace subjects (the duties of friendship, the limits of education, the pleasure of the countryside) and his exploration of extraordinary ones (the nature of cannibals, the identity of monstrous beings, the use of thumbs), Montaigne maps out for me my own curiosity, constellated at different times and in many places. “Books have been useful to me,” he confesses, “less for instruction than as training.” That has been precisely my case. The art of reading is in many ways opposed to the art of writing. 
Reflecting on Montaigne’s reading habits, for example, it occurred to me that it might be possible to make some notes on his “Que sais-je?” by following Montaigne’s own method of borrowing ideas from his library (he compared himself as a reader to a bee gathering pollen to make his own honey) and projecting these forward into my own time. 
As Montaigne would have willingly admitted, his examination of what we know was not a new venture in the sixteenth century: questioning the act of questioning had much older roots. “Whence then cometh wisdom?” asks Job in his distress, “and where is the place of understanding?” Enlarging on Job’s question, Montaigne observed that “judgment is a tool to use on all subjects, and comes in everywhere. Therefore in the tests that I make of it here, I use every sort of occasion. If it is a subject I do not understand at all, even on that I essay my judgment, sounding the ford from a good distance; and then, finding it too deep for my height, I stick to the bank.” I find this modest method wonderfully reassuring. 
According to Darwinian theory, human imagination is an instrument of survival. In order better to learn about the world, and therefore be better equipped to cope with its pitfalls and dangers, Homo sapiens developed the ability to reconstruct outer reality in the mind and to conceive situations that it could confront before actually encountering them. Conscious of ourselves and conscious of the world around us, we are able to build mental cartographies of those territories and explore them in an infinite number of ways, and then choose the best and most efficient. Montaigne would have agreed: we imagine in order to exist, and we are curious in order to feed our imaginative desire. 
Imagination, as an essential creative activity, develops with practice, not through successes, which are conclusions and therefore blind alleys, but through failures, through attempts that prove to be mistaken and require new attempts that will also, if the stars are kind, lead to new failures. The histories of art and literature, like those of philosophy and science, are the histories of such enlightened failures. “Fail. Try again. Fail better,” was Beckett’s summation. 
But in order to fail better we must be able to recognize, imaginatively, those mistakes and incongruities. We must be able to see that such-and-such a path does not lead us in the aspired direction, or that such-and-such a combination of words, colors, or numbers does not approximate the intuited vision in our mind. Proudly we record the moments in which our many inspired Archimedes shout “Eureka!” in their baths; we are less eager to recall the many more in which those, like the painter Frenhofer in Balzac’s story, look upon their unknown masterpiece and say, “Nothing, nothing!... I’ll have produced nothing!” Through those few moments of triumph and those many more of defeat runs the one great imaginative question: Why? 
Our education systems today by and large refuse to acknowledge the second half of our quests. Interested in little else than material efficiency and financial profit, our educational institutions no longer foster thinking for its own sake and the free exercise of the imagination. Schools and colleges have become training camps for skilled labor instead of forums for questioning and discussion, and colleges and universities are no longer nurseries for those inquirers whom Francis Bacon, in the sixteenth century, called “merchants of light.”9 We teach ourselves to ask “How much will it cost?” and “How long will it take?” instead of “Why?” 
“Why?” (in its many variations) is a question far more important in its asking than in the expectation of an answer. The very fact of uttering it opens numberless possibilities, can do away with preconceptions, summons up endless fruitful doubts. It may bring, in its wake, a few tentative answers, but if the question is powerful enough, none of these answers will prove all-sufficient. “Why?,” as children intuit, is a question that implicitly places our goal always just beyond the horizon. 
The visible representation of our curiosity—the question mark that stands at the end of a written interrogation in most Western languages, curled over itself against dogmatic pride—arrived late in our histories. In Europe, conventionalized punctuation was not established until the late Renaissance when, in 1566, the grandson of the great Venetian printer Aldo Manutius published his punctuation handbook for typesetters, the Interpungendi ratio . Among the signs devised to conclude a paragraph, the handbook included the medieval punctus interrogativus , and Manutius the Younger defined it as a mark that signaled a question which conventionally required an answer. One of the earliest instances of such question marks is in a ninth-century copy of a text by Cicero, now in the Bibliothèque nationale in Paris; it looks like a staircase ascending toward the top right in a squiggly diagonal from a dot at the bottom left. Questioning elevates us. Example of punctus interrogativus in a ninth-century manuscript of Cicero’s Cato maior de senectute . (Paris, Bibliothèque nationale, MS lat. 6332, fol. 81) 
Throughout our various histories, the question “Why?” has appeared under many guises and in vastly different contexts. The number of possible questions may seem too great to consider individually in depth and too varied to assemble coherently, and yet some attempts have been made to gather a few according to various criteria. For instance, a list of ten questions that “science must answer” (the “must” protests too much) was drawn up by scientists and philosophers invited by the editors of the Guardian of London in 2010. The questions were: “What is consciousness?” “What happened before the Big Bang?” “Will science and engineering give us back our individuality?” “How are we going to cope with the world’s burgeoning population?” “Is there a pattern to the prime numbers?” “Can we make a scientific way of thinking all-pervasive?” “How do we ensure humanity survives and flourishes?” “Can someone explain adequately the meaning of infinite space?” “Will I be able to record my brain like I can record a programme on television?” “Can humanity get to the stars?” There is no evident progression in these questions, no logical hierarchy, no clear evidence that they can be answered. They proceed by branching out from our desire to know, creatively sifting through our acquired wisdom. And yet, a certain shape might be glimpsed in their meandering. In following a necessarily eclectic path through a few of the questions sparked by our curiosity, something like a parallel cartography of our imagination may perhaps become apparent. What we want to know and what we can imagine are the two sides of the same magical page. 
One of the common experiences in most reading lives is the discovery, sooner or later, of one book that like no other allows for an exploration of oneself and of the world, that appears to be inexhaustible yet at the same time concentrates the mind on the tiniest particulars in an intimate and singular way. For certain readers, that book is an acknowledged classic, a work by Shakespeare or Proust, for example; for others it is a lesser-known or less agreed-upon text that deeply echoes for inexplicable or secret reasons. In my case, throughout my life, that unique book has changed: for many years it was Montaigne’s Essays or Alice in Wonderland , Borges’s Ficciones or Don Quixote , the Arabian Nights or The Magic Mountain . Now, as I approach the prescribed three score and ten, the book that is to me all-encompassing is Dante’s Commedia . 
I came to the Commedia late, just before turning sixty, and from the very first reading, it became for me that utterly personal yet horizonless book. To describe the Commedia as horizonless may be simply a way of declaring a kind of superstitious awe of the work itself: of its profundity, its breadth, its intricate construction. Even these words fall short of my constantly renewed experience of reading the text. Dante spoke of his poem as one “in which lend a hand heaven and earth.” This is not a hyperbole: it is the impression its readers have had from Dante’s age on. But construction implies an artificial mechanism, an act dependent on pulleys and cogs which, even when evident (as in Dante’s invention of the terza rima, for instance, and accordingly his use of the number 3 throughout the Commedia ), merely points to a speck in the complexity but hardly illuminates its apparent perfection. Giovanni Boccaccio compared the Commedia to a peacock whose body is covered with “angelic” iridescent feathers of countless hues. Jorge Luis Borges compared it to an infinitely detailed engraving, Giuseppe Mazzotta to a universal encyclopedia. Osip Mandelstam had this to say: “If the halls of the Hermitage should suddenly go mad, if the paintings of all schools and masters should suddenly break loose from the nails, should fuse, intermingle, and fill the air of the rooms with futuristic howling and colors in violent agitation, the result then would be something like Dante’s Commedia .” And yet none of these similes captures entirely the fullness, depth, reach, music, kaleidoscopic imagery, infinite invention, and perfectly balanced structure of the poem. The Russian poet Olga Sedakova has noted that Dante’s poem is “art that generates art” and “thought that generates thought” but, more important, it is “experience that generates experience.” 
In a parody of twentieth-century artistic currents, from the nouveau roman to conceptual art, Borges and his friend Adolfo Bioy Casares imagined a form of criticism that, surrendering to the impossibility of analyzing a work of art in all its greatness, merely reproduced the work in its entirety. Following this logic, in order to explain the Commedia , a meticulous commentator would have to end up quoting the whole poem. Perhaps that is the only way. It is true that when we come across an astonishingly beautiful passage or an intricate poetic argument that had not struck us as forcibly in a previous reading, our impulse is not so much to comment on it as to read it aloud to a friend, in order to share, as far as possible, the original epiphany. To translate the words into other experiences: maybe this is one of the possible meanings of Beatrice’s words to Dante in the Heaven of Mars: “Turn around and listen, / because not only in my eyes is Paradise.” 
Less ambitious, less knowledgeable, more conscious of my own horizons, I want to offer a few readings of my own, a few comments based on personal reflections, observations, translations into my own experience. The Commedia has a certain majestic generosity that does not bar entry to anyone attempting to cross its threshold. What each reader finds there is another matter. 
There is an essential problem with which every writer (and every reader) is faced when engaging with a text. We know that to read is to affirm our belief in language and its vaunted ability to communicate. Every time we open a book, we trust, in spite of all our previous experience, that this once the essence of the text will be conveyed to us. And every time we reach the last page, in spite of such brave hopes, we are again disappointed. Especially when we read what for want of more precise terms we agree to call “great literature,” our ability to grasp the text in all its multilayered complexity falls short of our desires and expectations, and we are compelled to return to the text once again in the hope that this time, perhaps, we will achieve our purpose. Fortunately for literature, fortunately for us, we never do. Generations of readers cannot exhaust these books, and the very failure of language to communicate fully lends them a limitless richness that we fathom only to the extent of our individual capabilities. No reader has ever reached the depths of the Mahabharata or the Oresteia . 
The realization that a task is impossible does not prevent us from attempting it, and every time a book is opened, every time a page is turned, we renew the hope of understanding a literary text, if not in its entirety, at least a little more than on the previous reading. That is how, throughout the ages, we create a palimpsest of readings that continuously reestablishes the book’s authority, always under a different guise. The Iliad of Homer’s contemporaries is not our Iliad , but it includes it, as our Iliad includes all Iliad s to come. In this sense, the Hassidic assertion that the Talmud has no first page because every reader has already begun reading it before starting at the first words is true of every great book. 
The term lectura dantis was created to define what has become a specific genre, the reading of the Commedia , and I am fully aware that, after generations of commentaries beginning with those of Dante’s own son Pietro, written shortly after his father’s death, it is impossible to be either comprehensively critical or thoroughly original in what one has to say about the poem. And yet, one might be able to justify such an exercise by suggesting that every reading is, in the end, less a reflection or translation of the original text than a portrait of the reader, a confession, an act of self-revelation and self-discovery. 
The first of these autobiographical readers was Dante himself. Throughout his otherworldly journey, having been told that he must find a new path in life or be lost forever, Dante is seized by an ardent curiosity to know who he truly is and what it is he experiences along the way. From the first verse of Inferno to the last verse of Paradiso , the Commedia is marked with Dante’s questions. 
In the whole of his essays, Montaigne quotes Dante only twice. Scholars are of the opinion that he had not read the Commedia but knew of it through references in the works of other writers. Even if he had read it, possibly Montaigne might not have liked the dogmatic structure within which Dante chose to conduct his explorations. Nevertheless, when discussing the power of speech in animals, Montaigne transcribes three verses from Purgatorio XXVI in which Dante compares the penitent lustful souls to “dark battalions of communicating ants.” And again he quotes Dante when discussing the education of children. “Let the tutor,” says Montaigne, “pass everything through a filter and never lodge anything in the boy’s head simply by authority, at second-hand. Let the principles of Aristotle not be principles for him any more than those of the Stoics or the Epicureans. Let this diversity of judgments be set before him; if he can, he will make a choice: if he cannot then he will remain in doubt. Only fools have made up their minds and are certain.” Montaigne then quotes the following line of Dante: “Not less than knowing, doubting ( dubbiar ) pleases me,” the words Dante addresses to Virgil in the sixth circle of hell, after the Latin poet has explained to his charge why the sins of incontinence are less offensive to God than those that are the fruit of our will. For Dante, the words express the pleasure felt in the expectant moment that precedes the acquisition of knowledge; for Montaigne, they describe a constant state of rich uncertainty, being aware of various opposing views but embracing none except one’s own. For both, the state of questioning is as rewarding as, or even more so than, that of knowing. 
Is it possible, as an atheist, to read Dante (or Montaigne) without believing in the God they worshiped? Is it presumptuous to assume a measure of understanding of their work without the faith that helped them bear the suffering, bewilderment, anguish (and also joy) that are the lot of every human being? Is it insincere to study the strict theological structures and subtleties of religious dogmas without being convinced by the tenets on which they are based? As a reader, I claim the right to believe in the meaning of a story beyond the particulars of the narrative, without swearing to the existence of a fairy godmother or a wicked wolf. Cinderella and Little Red Riding Hood don’t need to have been real people for me to believe in their truths. The god who walked in the garden “in the cool of the evening” and the god who, agonizing on a cross, promised Paradise to a thief, enlighten me in ways that nothing but great literature can. Without stories all religion would be mere preaching. It is stories that convince us. 
The art of reading is in many ways opposed to the art of writing. Reading is a craft that enriches the text conceived by the author, deepening it and rendering it more complex, concentrating it to reflect the reader’s personal experience and expanding it to reach the farthest confines of the reader’s universe and beyond. Writing, instead, is the art of resignation. The writer must accept the fact that the final text will be but a blurred reflection of the work conceived in the mind, less enlightening, less subtle, less poignant, less precise. The imagination of a writer is all-powerful, and capable of dreaming up the most extraordinary creations in all their wishful perfection. Then comes the descent into language, and in the passage from thought to expression much—very much—is lost. To this rule there are hardly any exceptions. To write a book is to resign oneself to failure, however honorable that failure might be. 
Conscious of my hubris, it occurred to me that, following Dante’s example of having a guide for his travels—Virgil, Statius, Beatrice, Saint Bernard—I might have Dante himself as a guide to mine, and allow his questioning to help steer my own. Though Dante admonished those who in tiny skiffs attempt to follow his keel, and warned them to turn back to their own shores for fear of becoming lost, I nevertheless trust that he will not mind helping out a fellow traveler filled with so much agreeable dubbiar.

(Boursier.com) — Dans le match que se livre Bouygues Telecom et Free Mobile, le second vient de remporter une manche décisive. 
En excluant les clients prépayés et en retenant uniquement les abonnés ayant souscrit un forfait, Bouygues Telecom devançait d'une courte tête le groupe de Xavier Niel en fin d'année 2014. Iliad revendiquait alors 10,105 Millions d'abonnés mobiles alors que Bouygues Telecom était à 10,130 Millions, soit un écart de 25.000. 
A la faveur du maintien d'une forte dynamique commerciale, Free Mobile vient de dépasser la filiale de Bouygues. Iliad a en effet gagné 420.000 nouveaux abonnés nets de résiliations sur le premier trimestre 2015 portant ainsi leur nombre total à 10,525 Millions. Pour sa part, Bouygues Telecom n'a séduit que 197.000 nouveaux abonnés sur trois mois, soit un total de 10,327 Millions. 
A fin mars, Free Mobile est devenu le troisième opérateur français en termes de nombre d'abonnés avec une avance de près de 200.000 forfaits sur Bouygues Telecom. Christophe Voisin —©2015, Boursier.com

(Boursier.com) — Dans le match que se livrent Bouygues Telecom et Free Mobile, le second vient de remporter une manche décisive. 
En excluant les clients prépayés et en retenant uniquement les abonnés ayant souscrit un forfait, Bouygues Telecom devançait d'une courte tête le groupe de Xavier Niel en fin d'année 2014. Iliad revendiquait alors 10,105 Millions d'abonnés mobiles alors que Bouygues Telecom était à 10,130 Millions, soit un écart de 25.000. 
A la faveur du maintien d'une forte dynamique commerciale, Free Mobile vient de dépasser la filiale de Bouygues. Iliad a en effet gagné 420.000 nouveaux abonnés nets de résiliations sur le premier trimestre 2015 portant ainsi leur nombre total à 10,525 Millions. Pour sa part, Bouygues Telecom n'a séduit que 197.000 nouveaux abonnés sur trois mois, soit un total de 10,327 Millions. 
A fin mars, Free Mobile est devenu le troisième opérateur français en termes de nombre d'abonnés avec une avance de près de 200.000 forfaits sur Bouygues Telecom. Christophe Voisin —©2015, Boursier.com

L'indice CAC 40 a perdu 35,49 points à 4.993,82 points, dans un volume d'échanges moyen de 4,1 milliards d'euros. La veille, il avait progressé de 1,36% à l'occasion d'un jour férié en France, rompant avec trois séances de baisse consécutives.

Les investisseurs se demandent donc comment la Réserve fédérale américaine tranchera le "dilemme entre céder face au ralentissement de la croissance ou considérer qu'il n'est que transitoire et relever malgré tout ses taux", a estimé M. Baradez."La production industrielle américaine baisse maintenant pour le 5e mois de suite" et "les mauvaises nouvelles continuent avec le sévère recul du moral des ménages en mai", a observé James Knightley, un économiste du bancassureur ING."Après des ventes de détails (en avril) fragiles, les espoirs d'observer un rebond décent de la croissance américaine au 2e trimestre après un premier trimestre difficile commencent à s'évaporer", a-t-il poursuivi. L'activité industrielle dans la région de New York a pour sa part connu une légère hausse en mai de 4 points (contre 4,5 attendue par le consensus des analystes). En outre, "au-delà des chiffres américains, la nervosité est toujours alimentée par le dossier grec", a souligné M. Baradez.

-=-=-TEXT: Cac 40 : Finit la semaine dans le rouge Aujourd'hui à 18:05 Tweet 
(Tradingsat.com) - La Bourse de Paris, en manque de catalyseurs, a fini la semaine sur une note négative. Vendredi, le CAC 40 a perdu 0,71% à 4 993 points, plombé par des statistiques décevantes aux Etats-Unis. 
L'indice "Empire State" ainsi que la confiance du consommateur n'ont pas été à la hauteur des attentes, rendant les investisseurs nerveux à Wall Street. 
Du côté des valeurs françaises, les marchés n'avaient pas grand chose à se mettre sous la dent. La prudence est restée de mise autour d' Iliad (+0,5%), dont l'activité fixe s'essouffle selon les derniers chiffres publiés ce matin par l'opérateur. Toutefois, la croissance du chiffre d'affaires a été au rendez-vous pour l'ensemble du Groupe au 1er trimestre (+7%). 
ArcelorMittal a clôturé à +1% avec le soutien d'un broker. L’aciériste avait flambé de près de 6% hier après l'annonce par la Commission européenne (CE) de l'ouverture d'une enquête antidumping sur la Chine et la Russie. Ces deux pays sont soupçonnés de vendre un type d'acier sur le marché européen à des prix inférieurs à leurs coûts de production. 
Enfin, la Cour d'appel de Londres a autorisé vendredi MyFerryLink, filiale du Groupe Eurotunnel (+0,4%) à continuer l'exploitation des navires entre Calais et Douvres, infirmant la décision de la Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Cette décision fait suite à une procédure d'appel lancée par la Scop, coopérative de salariés exploitant les bateaux du groupe de transport maritime. Julien Mouret - ©2015 Tradingsat.com

-=-=-TEXT: La Bourse de Paris finit en net recul (-0,71%) minée (...) La Bourse de Paris finit en net recul (-0,71%) minée par de mauvais chiffres américains La Bourse de Paris a fini la semaine en net recul (-0,71%) vendredi, minée par de mauvais chiffres américains qui ont à nouveau ramené la cote sous les 5.000 points. (Mis à jour le 15/05/2015 , par FranceTransactions.com (avec AFP) ) La Bourse de Paris finit en net recul (-0,71%) minée par de mauvais chiffres américains L’indice CAC 40 a perdu 35,49 points à 4.993,82 points, dans un volume d’échanges moyen de 4,1 milliards d’euros. La veille, il avait progressé de 1,36% à l’occasion d’un jour férié en France, rompant avec trois séances de baisse consécutives. Au lendemain de ce net rebond, la cote parisienne avait de nouveau ouvert du bon pied vendredi et réussi à s’y maintenir jusqu’à la publication d’un nouveau recul décevant de la production industrielle aux Ã‰tats-Unis en avrilsuivie peu après d’une baisse surprise du moral des ménages américains. "Le cumul de deux mauvais indicateurs aux Ã‰tats-Unis a tiré la cote parisienne et tous les indices européens à la baisse, après un début de séance calme", a résumé Alexandre Baradez, un analyste de IG France. Et ces publications décevantes "n’éloignent pas pour autant la perspective d’une remontée de ses taux directeurs par la Fed", ce qui aurait pu compenser l’impact négatif, a-t-il développé. Les chiffres du jour laissent en effet apparaître le fait que les consommateursaméricains "estiment que les prix vont repartir à la hausse", ce qui plaide plutôt pour une remontée des taux directeurs, tout comme les meilleurs chiffres d’emploi rendus publics hier, a-t-il ajouté. L’activité industrielle dans la région de New York a pour sa part connu une légère hausse en mai de 4 points . En outre, "au-delà des chiffres américains, la nervosité est toujours alimentée par le dossier grec", a souligné M. Baradez. Le gouvernement grec, en quête urgente d’un accord avec ses créanciers pour toucher une tranche de prêts vitale, souhaite mettre cette question au menu d’un sommet européen prévu à Riga la semaine prochaine, normalement consacréà l’Europe orientale. Du côté des valeurs, Iliad a grimpé de 0,48% à 218,00 euros, profitant de la publication d’unchiffre d’affaires en hausse de 7% au premier trimestre à 1,075 milliard d’euros. ArcelorMittal a bénéficié (+1,51% à 10,43 euros) du relèvement de sa recommandation à "acheter" contre "neutre" auparavant par Bank Of America-Merill Lynch. Les valeurs pétrolières et parapétrolières ont quant à elles fait les frais du repli des cours du brut.

-=-=-TITLE: Free Mobile subs growth drives strong sales
-=-=-SNIPPET: 
-=-=-TEXT: By Mary Lennighan , Total Telecom Friday 15 May 2015 French mobile operator estimates its own market share at 15%-plus by the end of March. 
Free Mobile added 420,000 new mobile customers in the first three months of 2015, triggering strong growth in its quarterly revenues. 
The French mobile operator had 10.53 million customers as of the end of March giving it a market share of above 15%, according to its own estimates. 
The firm's Q1 mobile revenues grew by 18.5% year-on-year to €437.9 million. 
Free Mobile was the primary growth driver for parent company Iliad in the first quarter, although the firm's fixed-line business still accounts for well over half of its turnover. 
Iliad posted overall revenue growth of 7% to €1.07 billion. The landline business contributed 60% of that, generating revenues of €639.7 million, an increase of 0.3% on the year-ago period. 
The operator's fixed broadband business added 77,000 new customers during the quarter, giving it a base of 5.95 million. It estimates that it took 42% of the market's net additions during the quarter. 
In total the group has 16.47 million customers. 
Iliad said it "stepped up its investments in ultrafast broadband" during the quarter, although it did not provide figures. 
Customer migration to VDSL2 and fibre-to-the-home (FTTH) services meant that the company had 700,000 customers receiving broadband speeds of over 30 Mbps by the end of March. 
Iliad confirmed that it aims to achieve more than 10% growth in consolidated EBITDA in full-year 2015, but it did not provide EBITDA numbers for the quarter. Comment here

(Boursier.com) — Le CAC40 a finalement clôturé ce vendredi en retrait de 0,71% à 4.994 pts, après la publication de mauvaises statistiques outre-Atlantique (indice de confiance de l'Université du Michigan et production industrielle américaine). L'indice de confiance des Américains selon l'Université du Michigan a accusé sa plus forte baisse en deux ans au mois de mai (lecture préliminaire), alors que les chiffres de la production industrielle ont reflété une baisse inattendue. L'indice Empire State de la Fed de New York a par ailleurs manqué le consensus. 
ECO ET DEVISES 
L'indice LEI ('leading economic index') du Conference Board concernant le Royaume-Uni a progressé de 0,2% au mois de mars. Avec cette hausse du mois de mars, le LEI britannique a progressé pour le troisième mois consécutif. Par conséquent, son taux de croissance à six mois est de retour en territoire positif. 
L'indice suisse des prix à la production et à l'import, calculé par le bureau fédéral des statistiques (FSO), a décliné de 2,1% en avril 2015, en comparaison du mois antérieur, à 92,4 points. De plus bas prix ont en particulier été constatés dans la machinerie, l'électronique et les produits optiques, les produits de métal, les équipements électriques, les véhicules motorisés et les équipements médicaux. 
L'indice du sentiment des consommateurs américains de l'Université du Michigan pour le mois de mai 2015, en lecture préliminaire, est ressorti à seulement 88,6, contre un consensus proche de 96 et un niveau de 95,9 fin avril. Il s'agit de la plus forte baisse en plus de deux ans pour cet indice de confiance américain. Il faut en effet remonter au mois de décembre 2012 pour retrouver une correction équivalente, selon Bloomberg. L'indice de perception des conditions actuelles a régressé à 99,8 en mai, contre 107 un mois avant. La mesure des anticipations à six mois a chuté à 81,5, contre 88,8. 
Selon la Fed ce vendredi, la production industrielle américaine du mois d'avril 2015 a reculé de 0,3% en comparaison du mois antérieur, alors que les économistes tablaient en moyenne sur une performance stable. La baisse de la production en mars a été révisée à 0,3%. Le taux d'utilisation des capacités en avril s'est établi à 78,2%, contre 78,4% de consensus. La production manufacturière du mois d'avril n'a pratiquement pas évolué en comparaison du mois antérieur, après un gain révisé à +0,3% pour le mois de mars. 
L'indice d'activité manufacturière régionale 'Empire State' de la Fed de New York pour le mois de mai 2015 est ressorti à seulement +3,1, contre un consensus de place voisin de +5. Positif, l'indicateur traduit toutefois une croissance de l'activité manufacturière régionale en mai. 
VALEURS EN HAUSSE 
* Lexibook (+33% à 3,02 euros) : grosse envolée spéculative pour le dossier, dopé par la publication du chiffre d'affaires du dernier trimestre 2014-2015, en nette amélioration. Il ne s'agit pas vraiment d'une prouesse dans la mesure où les revenus étaient négatifs un an plus tôt sur la période, à cause de nombreux retours produits après des méventes, notamment dans les tablettes. Cependant avec 5,5 ME de revenus, ce dernier trimestre 2014-2015 est meilleur que ceux des précédents exercices affichant un profil moins atypique que celui de 2013-2014 (2,5 ME en 2012-2013, 1,4 ME en 2011-2012 et 2,9 ME en 2010-2011). 
* Avanquest (+60% à 0,32 euro) : la société est en situation précaire, avec une énorme augmentation de capital en cours sur laquelle elle joue sa survie. Mais ses revenus sur neuf mois sont intéressants, avec une croissance à deux chiffres. Là encore, le dossier très spéculatif fait le bonheur des traders. 
* Thales (+1,4% à 55,09 euros) : belle progression, soutenue par la recommandation "surpondérer" de Barclays, qui a relevé de 52 à 60 euros sa valorisation. 
* ArcelorMittal (+1% à 10,375 euros) : l'aciériste poursuit sur sa lancée de la veille, 5% de hausse, après la décision de la Commission européenne de durcir son action antidumping en lançant une enquête sur la Chine et la Russie. BofA ML est par ailleurs passé de "neutre" à "acheter" sur le dossier. 
* SIPH (+0,9% à 37,6 euros) : le groupe a publié des chiffres en berne au premier trimestre, mais entrevoit l'embellie sur les prochains mois. 
* Iliad (+0,5% à 218 euros) : le groupe a démarré le millésime 2015 sur un chiffre d'affaires en hausse de 7% et des recrutements en progression, même si le rythme de hausse dans le fixe est faible dans un marché mature. L'opérateur confirme viser une croissance de son EBITDA supérieure à 10%. 
VALEURS EN BAISSE 
* ASK (-3,2% à 2,42 euros) : le spécialiste des solutions sans contact reste pénalisé par une publication trimestrielle décevante. 
* CGG (-1,5% à 6,82 euros) : ce matin, Canaccord Genuity a réitéré sa recommandation "conserver" et son objectif de cours de 6 euros, après avoir analysé au calme les comptes trimestriels de la société. L'analyste voit des éléments positifs mais regrette des zones d'ombre dans la dernière communication. Jean-Noël Legalland —©2015, Boursier.com

Le secteur minier a terminé dans le rouge, avec Glencore (-1,81% à 293,3 pence), Anglo American (-1,80% à 1.090,5 pence) ou BHP Billiton (-1,03% à 1.533 pence). Le secteur pétrolier a pour sa part souffert de la baisse des cours, avec Royal Dutch Shell (action "A" -1,34% à 1.991,5 pence) et BP (-0,96% à 452,4 pence). SABMiller a pris 0,65% à 3.623,5 pence. Francfort a lâché 0,98% à 11'447,03 points tandis que le MDax des valeurs moyennes a grappillé 0,12% à 20'602,57 points. Seuls Fresenius Medical Care (+0,26% à 76,20 euros) et Infineon (+0,40% à 11,39 euros) sont parvenus à tirer leur épingle du jeu, ainsi que, de justesse, Deutsche Post (+0,02% à 28,15 euros). Le groupe de chimie-pharmacie Merck KGaA a perdu 0,54% à 99,86 euros. Continental a abandonné 1,94% à 209,25 euros. Son concurrent allemand ZF a annoncé vendredi avoir finalisé l'acquisition pour près de 10 milliards d'euros de l'américain TRW Automotive après le feu vert des autorités de la concurrence, ce qui va lui permettre de devenir un des plus grands équipementiers automobiles mondiaux. Le fabricant d'engrais K+S a fini lanterne rouge (-2,77% à 28,73 euros). Milan a baissé de 0,32% à 23'474 points. Le fabricant de câbles Prysmian a progressé de 1,61% à 20,89 euros et la banque Intesa Sanpaolo de 1,03% à 3,324 euros. Les banques populaires également ont vu leurs valeurs progresser. A l'inverse, le pétrolier Eni a reculé de 1,74% à 16,95 euros et la banque toscane BMPS de 3,62% à 0,546 euro dans l'attente de nouvelles sur l'augmentation de capital prévue d'ici fin mai. Madrid a perdu 0,71% à 11'317,3 points. Dans les bancaires, le leader Santander a lâché 1,29% à 6,64 euros, son principal concurrent BBVA 0,96% à 9,07 euros et CaixaBank 1,23% à 4,42 euros. Repsol a chuté de 1,40% à 17,90 euros et Telefónica de 1,29% à 13 euros. La Bourse suisse a été une des seules bourses européennes à finir en hausse, grimpant de 0,65% à 9109,92 points. Richemont, numéro deux mondial du luxe, a affiché la plus forte hausse (+2,77% à 83,60 francs suisses), suivi par la banque Julius Baer (+1,92% à 49,82 francs suisses). Adecco, spécialiste du travail temporaire, a également gagné 1,77% à 74,65 francs suisses après avoir annoncé que la société de gestion de fonds Artisan Partners LP avait augmenté sa participation à 5,40%. L'indice a été soutenu par Roche qui s'est apprécié de 1,75% à 273,60 CHF après la publication jeudi de données prometteuses pour des traitements à l'étude lors du congrès de la Société américaine d'oncologie clinique (Asco). L'agrochimiste Syngenta a en revanche reculé de 0,77% à 399,90 CHF. Le cours de l'action s'était envolé la semaine dernière après avoir rejeté une proposition de reprise de son rival américain Monsanto, les analystes s'interrogeant depuis sur un éventuel relèvement de l'offre. Bruxelles a également fini dans le vert, prenant 0,16% à 3674,05 points. Le groupe de distribution Delaize enregistre une des plus fortes progressions: +1,19% à 83,48 euros et le groupe métallurgique Bekaert la plus forte chute: -1,68% à 26,88 euros.

AMSTERDAM (ANP) - De Europese aandelenbeurzen wisten vrijdagmiddag de winsten van een dag eerder verder uit te breiden. De stabilisering van de rentes op de obligatiemarkten en een nieuw slotrecord van de Amerikaanse S&P 500-index zorgden voor optimisme onder beleggers. 
,,De beurzen gaan in lijn met Wall Street verder omhoog en de Griekse problemen worden weer even aan de kant geschoven. Het is verder een relatief rustige beursdag. De beursvolumes zijn laag en het is vooral wachten op wat de markt volgende week gaat doen", aldus handelaar Cees Smit van Today's Beheer. 
De AEX-index in Amsterdam noteerde aan het begin van de middag 0,9 procent hoger op 494,93 punten. De MidKap steeg 0,4 procent tot 762,83 punten. De beurzen in Londen, Parijs en Frankfurt kregen er tot 0,5 procent bij. 
DSM 
Grootste stijger in de AEX was speciaalchemiebedrijf DSM met een winst van 3,5 procent, op geruchten dat het Duitse Evonik weer interesse heeft in een overname van het Nederlandse speciaalchemiebedrijf. 
ArcelorMittal volgde op de voet met een winst van 3,4 procent, na een adviesverhoging door Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Het staalbedrijf won een dag eerder al bijna 6 procent, nadat Brussel aankondigde een onderzoek te starten naar het vermeende dumpen van staalproducten door China en Rusland. 
Vopak 
Olieconcern Shell en tankopslagbedrijf Vopak waren de enige dalers met verliezen van 0,5 en 0,4 procent. 
In de MidKap ging bouwbedrijf BAM aan kop met een plus van meer dan 3 procent. Grootste daler was biotechnologiebedrijf Galapagos met een min van 3,7 procent. Beleggers namen wat winst na de koersstijging van ruim 14 procent op donderdag. 
Inverko 
Op de lokale markt maakte Inverko een koerssprong van 7,5 procent. Het recyclingbedrijf verwacht dat de omzet in de komende kwartalen zal herstellen en aantrekken. 
Roche won bijna 3 procent in Zürich. De Zwitserse farmaceut maakte positieve testresultaten van een aantal kandidaatmedicijnen bekend. In Parijs klom Iliad 0,7 procent, na een positief kwartaalbericht van de Franse telecomgroep. 
De euro bleef nagenoeg onveranderd op 1,1363 dollar. De prijs van een vat Amerikaanse olie zakte 0,4 procent naar 59,62 dollar. Brentolie steeg een fractie in prijs tot 66,73 dollar per vat.

AMSTERDAM (ANP) - De aandelenbeurs in Amsterdam is vrijdagochtend licht hoger geopend. Ook de andere Europese effectenmarkten begonnen met kleine winsten, in navolging van het nieuwe slotrecord van de Amerikaanse S&P 500-index. De blik is onder meer gericht op de Verenigde Staten, waar later op de dag cijfers over de industriële productie en het consumentenvertrouwen op het programma staan. 
De AEX-index in Amsterdam noteerde in de vroege handel 0,7 procent hoger op 493,98 punten. De MidKap steeg 0,2 procent tot 761,78 punten. De beurzen in Londen, Parijs en Frankfurt kregen er tot 0,4 procent bij. 
Grootste stijger in de AEX was ArcelorMittal met een winst van meer dan 2 procent, na een adviesverhoging door Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Olieconcern Shell sloot de rij met een verlies van 0,3 procent. 
Besi 
In de MidKap profiteerde toeleverancier aan de chipindustrie Besi (plus 1,7 procent) van een adviesverhoging door Kepler Cheuvreux. Grootste daler was biotechnologiebedrijf Galapagos met een min van 3,8 procent. Beleggers namen wat winst na de koersstijging van ruim 14 procent op donderdag. 
Op de lokale markt maakte Inverko een koerssprong van 8,6 procent, na publicatie van een kwartaalbericht. Het recyclingbedrijf, dat in het afgelopen kwartaal nog worstelde met de financiële herstructurering van onderdeel Inverko Polymers, verwacht dat de omzet in de komende kwartalen zal herstellen en aantrekken. 
Iliad 
In Parijs klom Iliad 1 procent. De Franse telecomgroep zag de omzet in het eerste kwartaal toenemen dankzij een sterke groei in de activiteiten op het gebied van mobiele telefonie. 
De euro noteerde vrijdagochtend op 1,1387 dollar, tegen 1,1359 dollar bij het slot van de Europese beurshandel op donderdag. De prijs van een vat Amerikaanse olie zakte 0,5 procent naar 59,58 dollar. Brentolie daalde 0,4 procent in prijs tot 66,45 dollar per vat.

-=-=-TEXT: Celular que bloqueia publicidade é novo plano de operadoras 
DO "FINANCIAL TIMES" RSS Publicidade 
Diversas operadoras de telefonia móvel planejam bloquear publicidade em suas redes, o que prepara o terreno para uma batalha com companhias de mídia digital como o Google, AOL e Yahoo!. 
Uma operadora europeia de telefonia móvel disse ao "Financial Times" que havia instalado software de bloqueio de publicidade em suas centrais de processamento e planejava ativá-lo antes do fim de 2015. 
O software previne que a maioria dos anúncios seja exibida em páginas da web e apps, ainda que não interfira com anúncios inseridos nos feeds de serviços como o Facebook e o Twitter. 
A tecnologia de bloqueio foi desenvolvida pela Shine, uma start-up israelense cujos acionistas incluem a Horizon Ventures, fundo de investimento de Li Ka-shing, o homem mais rico da Ásia. Marcio Jose Sanchez - 5.jun.14/Associated Press Google é um dos alvos das operadoras de telefonia móvel, que pretendem forçar empresas de mídia digital a dividir receita com publicidade online 
Li também controla a Hutchinson Whampoa, uma das maiores companhias mundiais de telecomunicações. 
"Dezenas de milhões de assinantes de telefonia móvel em todo o mundo terão a opção de bloquear anúncios antes do final deste ano", disse Roi Carthy, o vice-presidente de marketing da Shine. 
"Se a tendência ganhar corpo, isso pode ter impacto devastador sobre o setor de publicidade on-line." 
A Verizon, maior operadora de telecomunicações dos Estados Unidos, adquiriu nesta semana a AOL por US$ 4,4 bilhões, a fim de ganhar entrada no mercado crescente de publicidade para aparelhos móveis. 
Os anunciantes investirão US$ 69 bilhões em anúncios para aparelhos móveis este ano –mais que o triplo do total registrado dois anos atrás–, de acordo com o grupo de pesquisa eMarketer. 
A Shine anunciou que está trabalhando com diversas operadoras, entre as quais uma com quase 40 milhões de assinantes, ainda que não as tenha identificado. 
Um executivo de uma operadora europeia confirmou que ela e diversas de suas rivais estão planejando começar a bloquear publicidade ainda neste ano. 
O executivo disse que sua empresa inicialmente lançará um serviço sem publicidade para adesão voluntária por seus assinantes. 
A BOMBA 
Mas também está considerando uma ideia mais radical, apelidada de "a bomba", que seria aplicada a toda a sua rede de milhões de assinantes simultaneamente. A ideia é tomar o Google por alvo específico, bloqueando a publicidade veiculada nos sites da empresa em uma tentativa de forçá-la a ceder parte de sua receita. 
A companhia de buscas do Vale do Silício é a maior empresa de publicidade do planeta, gerando US$ 60 bilhões ao ano com publicidade vinculada a buscas, veiculada nos vídeos do YouTube e por meio de serviços como a Google Display Network e a DoubleClick, que obtêm anúncios para sites de terceiros. 
O executivo da operadora de telefonia móvel que está pensando em usar "a bomba" reconheceu que tomar o Google por alvo pode ser arriscado tanto do ponto de vista jurídico quanto do de relações públicas. Sob as regras da "neutralidade de rede" que vigoram na União Europeia e nos Estados Unidos, as companhias de telecomunicações são forçadas a tratar todos os dados que fluem por suas redes igualmente. Mas, mesmo nesses mercados, seria viável bloquear anúncios no Google "por apenas uma hora ou um dia", a fim de forçar a companhia a negociar, disse o executivo. 
Muitas operadoras de telefonia móvel estão frustradas por as empresas de mídia digital poderem faturar com suas redes de alta velocidade sem que precisem investir na infraestrutura que as mantém funcionando. Essa irritação se inflamou ainda mais no ano passado quando o Google lançou a Project Fi, sua operadora de serviços sem fio nos Estados Unidos. 
O Google afirmou que não seria razoável que as operadoras de telefonia móvel bloqueassem anúncios, argumentando que "as pessoas pagam por pacotes de internet móvel para que tenham acesso a apps, vídeos em formato stream, webmail e outros serviços que amam, muitos dos quais bancados por publicidade. O Google e outras companhias de internet investem pesadamente nesses serviços –e na infraestrutura que os permite operar, nos bastidores". 
Bloquear publicidade em redes móveis deve provocar reação furiosa das companhias de mídia digital. Em 2013, o Free, provedor francês de acesso à internet controlado pela Iliad, começou a bloquear publicidade como padrão, em seu modem Freebox, causando forte controvérsia. A empresa foi forçada a abandonar a iniciativa depois de uma semana, sob forte pressão do governo socialista da França. 
Carthy, da Shine, disse que eliminar publicidade intrusiva é um "direito do consumidor", mesmo que prejudique o modelo de negócios das empresas de conteúdo online que dependem da publicidade. 
"A publicidade on-line está fora de controle e poluindo a experiência do usuário", ele disse. Pop-ups, vídeos de execução automática e outras formas de publicidade digital podem consumir de 10% a 50% do plano de dados do usuário, ele acrescentou. 
Embora o bloqueio de anúncios seja novidade nos aparelhos móveis, nos computadores está mais estabelecido, e vem se expandindo rapidamente. Mais de 140 milhões de pessoas, ou 5% da população on-line, usam software como o Adblock Plus para eliminar publicidade quando navegam na Web em laptops e desktops. 
Como reportou o "Financial Times" em fevereiro, Google, Microsoft e Amazon pagaram aos produtores do Adblock Plus para permitir que alguns dos anúncios em seus sites passassem pelos filtros do programa. 
O relacionamento entre o Google e os serviços de bloqueio de publicidade fica ainda mais complicado por esse tipo de software ser o acessório mais popular para o popular navegador Chrome desenvolvido pela empresa. Tradução de PAULO MIGLIACCI

(Boursier.com) — Iliad a terminé la séance en légère progression de 0,5% à 218 euros, après avoir démarré le millésime 2015 sur un chiffre d'affaires en hausse de 7% et des recrutements en progression, même si le rythme de hausse dans le fixe est faible dans un marché mature... Oddo qui reste à l'achat sur le dossier vise un cours de 240 euros parle d'un "T1 en ligne et de bons recrutements d'abonnés qui pèsent sur l'ARPU fixe sur fond d'accélération du déploiement du réseau"... Pour le CM-CIC, il convient toujours d'accumuler en ciblant aussi un cours de 240 euros. 
Le groupe a amélioré de 7% son chiffre d'affaires du premier trimestre, pour le porter à 1,074 milliard d'euros. Le mobile (+18,5% à 437,9 ME) tire toujours la croissance, tandis que le fixe stagne (639,7 ME, +0,3%). L'opérateur revendique 10,525 millions d'abonnés mobiles (+4,1% en trois mois) et 5,945 millions d'abonnés fixes (+1,3% en trois mois). 
42% des recrutements haut débit du trimestre 
Dans le mobile, la part de marché dépasse 15%, selon une estimation interne, et l'opérateur se targue d'être le principal recruteur d'abonnés en France pour le 13ème mois consécutif. En haut débit, les recrutements nets ont atteint 77.000 clients sur le trimestre, soit 42% du marché. L'arrivée de nouveaux abonnés a été dopée par la réalisation d'une "vente privée" en début d'année, ce qui a aussi à l'inverse pesé sur le revenu moyen par abonné puisque l'ARPU a baissé à 34,70 euros par abonné fin mars, contre 35,10 euros fin décembre et 35,50 euros fin septembre. Sur l'offre Freebox Revolution, l'ARPU reste supérieur à 38 euros. La migration des abonnés vers le VDSL2 et le FTTH continue, et Free revendique plus de 700.000 abonnés pouvant bénéficier de plus de 30 Mbits/s de débit, soit environ 11,8% du parc. 
L'opérateur confirme viser une croissance de son EBITDA supérieure à 10%... La Rédaction —©2015, Boursier.com
