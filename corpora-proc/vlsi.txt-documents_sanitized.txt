NL efficient tpg design is related to step ( 1 ) and it is an important subject in bist . NL generation of test vector sequences with low power consumption and high fault coverage in minimal hardware size is the main objective of this proposed approach . NL in recent years , power consumption during testing has become an important issue in test manufacturing because high circuit activity rate during test generation and / or high fan - out of bist components may result in passing the package power consumption limits which in turn may risk the health of the test [ 1 , 2 ] . NL power consumption of vlsi during test application can be as high as 200 % of that in normal mode as reported in [ 2 , 3 ] . NL therefore , reducing power consumption in test mode is becoming an important objective in circuit design . the techniques used in [ 4 , 5 ] usually incur fewer mathematical constraints but require a variable - length encoding of the test cubes , and this complicates the communication between the ate and the chips . NL thermal - aware methodology [ 6 ] can save 17 . 5 % more power consumed by the repeaters but it allows delay . in [ 7 , 8 ] , low transition test vector is inserted between two consecutive patterns , even if there are a few number of transitions . this method increases testing time . the hybrid method [ 9 ] only concentrated on avoiding repeated pattern generation and the methods in [ 10 , 11 ] are used for reduction of the memory size needed for test pattern storage . NL in the proposed scheme , the multiple seeds are stored in rom , which are used to skip the nondetecting vectors . for each seed , the inputs of cut are divided into two groups ( partial - acting inputs and partial - freezing inputs ) according to determined number of transitions . if number of transitions increased , test vectors are generated using random bits insertion and frozen partial test pattern . this decreases vertical transitions , reducing dynamic power dissipation . NL in [ 12 – 14 ] a twisted ring counter along with some reseeding logic is employed to generate the required patterns . a control unit is used to load seed patterns into the input scan registers and to perform the trc operations so as to generate more patterns from the seeds . but the experimental results show that long test application time is still needed to achieve complete fault coverage . NL the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , prior work regarding tpg is given . section 3 describes the proposed atpg circuit and the state diagram of fsm which is used to implement the proposed scheme . it is followed by hardware implementation small size ( 8 - bit cut ) circuit in section 4 . section 5 presents experimental results for the iscas benchmark circuits . section 6 concludes the paper . 2 . prior work NL many schemes were proposed for generating low power test patterns using lfsr as atpg . in some methods two clocks are used which also increase power dissipation . the method using rsic ( random single input change ) test generation generates low transition test patterns but at additional cost for reducing power . NL in one method using lfsr as tpg , flip flops are divided into two sets which make the circuit complex . in this paper , ring counter is used as test pattern generator and an external circuit is added with tpg for reducing switching transitions makes the circuit simple . 3 . proposed rc - atpg NL the general architecture of the proposed scheme is shown in figure 1 with rom and cut . the seeds are fed from rom to atpg whenever it is needed . the tpg is nothing but a ring counter ( rc ) which generates test patterns . each test pattern is applied to switching transition counter ( stc ) circuit to determine its number of switching transitions before it is sent to cut . depending upon the number of transitions fsm generates outputs . the outputs are applied as select lines to bit selector circuits . if the test pattern has more number of transitions , test vectors are inserted by bsc which reduces vertical transitions . figure 1 : general architecture of the proposed method . NL with regular interval , seed value is applied from rom , to avoid the same pattern generation . seed value is applied in parallel which reduces the time for seed application . seed value is obtained using any optimization algorithm . normally in test pattern generation genetic algorithm is used as optimization algorithm . NL in this rc - based tpg the d - ffs are replaced by modified d - ffs ( figure 3 ) . initially each test pattern is equally divided into two parts as least significant bytes and most significant bytes . half of the flip flop outputs , that is , lsb of the test pattern , are applied to cut through bit selector lsb circuit . bsc generates partial insertion bits . the remaining ( msb ) half of the test pattern must be frozen during test vector insertion using bit selector msb circuit . NL during test vector insertion , lsb is replaced by random bits with frozen msb . first test vector is the combination of present msb with random bits as lsb . in the next clock pulse actual lsb of new or next test pattern is applied with the same msb . in both clock pulses ( random bit insertion and original lsb of tp ) msb of test pattern is frozen . in the third pulse next msb is applied . NL in this proposed scheme , all inputs are divided into two groups . one part is the partial - freezing bits , and the other part is the partial insertion bits . in order to implement the proposed scheme , external circuit ( stc , fsm , and bsc ) is included with rc - based tpg . 3 . 1 . rc - atpg NL normally , ring counter is constructed by any type of flip flops in which the previous output of flip flop is applied as input to the successive flip flop and the last flip flop output is connected with the first flip flop input . NL the proposed tpg is implemented using ring counter , which is constructed by using modified d - flip flops ( see figure 2 ) . each d - ff is combined with multiplexer which is known as modified flip flop . the initial value ( seed ) is applied to tpg to start test pattern generation . the operation of the register is deterministic ; the stream of values produced by the register is completely determined by its current ( or previous ) state . the output of tpg is directly connected with first ff , which forms a ring counter ( rc ) . figure 2 : ring counter atpg . figure 3 : modified flip flop . NL modified flip flop ( m - ff ) is the combination of d - ff and multiplexer . it has 4 inputs and only one output . select line of mux is used to input the seed value or for ring operation which generates test patterns . NL m - ff has five input lines and one output line . it works as in table 1 . multiplexer selects either seed input or next test pattern bit . the output of multiplexer is applied to d - ff . flip flop with enable signal is used here . during test vector insertion , the test pattern generation must be hold using the enable signal . table 1 : operation performed by modified ff . NL seed is stored in rom and applied in parallel by asserting the select input of m - ff as “ 1 ” . if the select input of m - ff is “ 0 ” then the ring counter starts to generate test patterns using ring operation . with regular interval seed must be applied from rom to avoid the same test pattern generation . seeds are also used to generate test patterns that have high fault coverage . NL here each flip flop is replaced by modified flip flop . initially the seed value is applied by asserting the select line which is equal to logic “ 1 ” . then the select line is deserted and the ring operation is started which generates test patterns . the test patterns are applied through bsc / fc circuit ( which reduces vertical switching transitions ) to cut . 3 . 2 . switching transition counter NL switching transition counter consists of xor gates , full adders , and an or gate . each consecutive test pattern bit is applied to xor gate . if the test bits are not the same then the xor gate output is 1 . these 1 ’ s are added using full adders . NL more numbers of 1 ’ s give carry output of full adder equal to 1 . more numbers of carry = 1 indicate that the number of transitions between consecutive test patterns is more . the carry output of full adders is given to an or gate . the or gate output is applied as input to the fsm . NL xor gates are used to check the transition between horizontal bits . the number of required xor gates is equal to where “ ” is number of bits in the test pattern . the carry outputs of all full adders are ored to check the total number transitions . NL figure 4 shows st counter for an 8 - bit tpg circuit . the number of xor gates , full adders , and or gate depends on the number of cut inputs and it can be reduced according to our requirement . if the number of test pattern bits is more , then the successive carry outputs are and ed before applied to the or gate . figure 4 : switching transition counter . 3 . 3 . finite state machine NL fsm has a single input , three outputs ( , , and en ) , and 3 states . state diagram of fsm is shown in figure 5 . output of stc is the input for fsm . it generates outputs and which are the select line for bsc and freezer multiplexer . the three states are a , b , c and the initial state of fsm is a . figure 5 : state diagram of fsm . NL depending on the input “ , ” fsm changes its states . the outputs of fsm are applied as select inputs to bsc . during state a , the outputs are . for b state . in state a new test pattern is generated and its transitions are calculated . NL more numbers of transitions are indicated by the input equal to 1 from stc circuit . table 2 shows the function performed at each state of fsm . during b state random bits are inserted in lsb portion of test pattern . in b and c states partial pattern ( msb ) is frozen . the above process is done for each pattern that is generated by ring counter . test vectors are inserted between the consecutive patterns which are having high transitions . table 2 : function performed at each fsm state . NL the function performed in each state of fsm is as follows : statea : . the generated new test pattern is sent to cut directly , if it has less vertical switching transitions . stateb : . lsb of test pattern is filled with random bits and msb of present test pattern is frozen . statec : . msb of present test pattern is frozen and lsb is replaced by the new test pattern bits . statea : . the msb is replaced by new test pattern and lsb is kept as it is . fsm generates enable signal also . this enable output is given to each m - ff , to disable test pattern generation during test vector insertion . enable is logic “ 0 ” in states b and c . at state a , it is logic “ 1 ” which starts the test pattern generation . 3 . 4 . bit selector circuit NL bsc is used for test vector generation and insertion . separate circuit arrangement is used for ls bits and ms bits of tpg outputs ( see figures 6 ( a ) and 6 ( b ) ) . for 8 - bit tpg the least 4 ff outputs are connected with bsc - lsb and remaining most significant output bits are applied to bsc - msb circuits . figure 6 : ( a ) bit selector circuit , lsb . ( b ) bit selector circuit , msb . NL bsc - lsb is constructed by using 2 : 1 multiplexers with simple and gate . the output line from fsm is applied as select input . lsb of each test vector is either next tp bit or random bit . random bit “ ” is the and gate output of present and next test pattern bits ( , ) . for only one clock pulse the lsb is replaced with random bits . in next two pulses lsb is filled with new test pattern bits . NL in bsc - msb only one 2 : 1 multiplexer is used . fsm output is used as select line and it selects either present or next test pattern bits . for first two clock pulses msb is not changed . it remains on present test pattern and the third clock pulse new test pattern is applied at ms portion . NL bsc generates test vectors which are inserted between consecutive test patterns to reduce vertical transition between consecutive test patterns . NL random bit “ ” is and output of present and next test pattern : NL “ ” is used to reduce switching transition during test mode . it needs a simple and gate . in the method proposed in [ 15 ] a separate primary input line for random bit insertion is needed . but in this method random bit is generated using present and next test pattern values which avoid the primary input line . NL random bit generated using present and next test pattern also decreases the number of vertical transitions . random bit generated in this proposed method is either present test pattern bit or next test pattern bit . therefore the random bit insertion does not increase unnecessary switching transition between two test patterns . 4 . implementation of proposed method for 8 - bit cut NL an 8 - bit cut requires 8 - bit test pattern input during test mode . therefore proposed tpg is constructed using 8 modified flip flops ( see figure 7 ) . the least four ( ff 0 to ff 3 ) flip flop outputs are given to bsc - lsb , and the outputs of ff 4 to ff 7 are applied to bsc - msb ( simple mux ) circuit . the bit select circuit outputs are given as test mode inputs to the cut . figure 7 : implementation of proposed method . NL eight - bit seed is applied from rom to rc - tpg when the select input line “ sel ” is “ 1 ” . initially “ sel ” is asserted and seed is applied from rom . then “ sel ” is changed to logic “ 0 ” and ring operation is started which produces test patterns . with particular interval seed should be given to avoid repeated test pattern generation . for each clock a test pattern is generated by the ring counter . NL the generated patterns are given to stc to find the total number of switching transitions . if the number of transitions is more test vectors are inserted between test patterns by bs circuit . NL for an 8 - bit cut , eight xor gates , two full adders , and an or gate are required to construct stc circuit . bsc needs 4 and gates ( for random bit generation ) and eight multiplexers ( 2 : 1 mux ) . fsm has one input line and 3 output lines . NL during state b , bsc - lsb replaces the least significant test pattern bits into random bits for test vector generation . the msb should be frozen for both random bit insertion time and lsb release time . in the third state msb is changed into next test pattern value . NL test vectors are formed by msb of present test pattern and random bits or new test pattern value of lsb . the test vectors are sent to cut in between two consecutive test patterns which increase the correlation . the patterns with less switching transitions are sent to cut directly . figure 8 shows a small example of inserting test vectors between two consecutive test patterns fed to cut . figure 8 : generated test patterns for 8 - bit cut . tp 1 and tp 2 : consecutive test patterns ; and : test vectors . 5 . experimental results NL the proposed rc - tpg was implemented using xilinx software ( verilog language ) in which vcd should be generated after simulation . the obtained results proved that the 50 % of dynamic power dissipation is reduced by test vector insertion . NL test patterns sent to cut have less horizontal and vertical transition than generated test patterns . in between high transition patterns test vectors are inserted ( a1 and a5 ) to reduce number of transitions ( see figure 8 ) . test vectors are formed using random bits which are shown in bold letters . the new test vector is generated by combining a part from present test pattern and another part from random bit insertion . the random bits reduce transition between consecutive patterns . NL table 3 shows the peak and average power of lfsr and proposed tpg ( rc - atpg ) for iscas benchmarks . as expected , rc - atpg reduces the average and peak power . the proposed atpg reduces up to 38 . 5 % and 50 % of the average and peak power , respectively . table 3 : power reduction for iscas benchmarks . NL in the proposed atpg external circuit consists of switching transition counter , fsm , and bit selector circuit . the fsm size is fixed . table 4 shows the area overhead when rc - tpg is used for test pattern generation . compared to conventional method the area overhead increases up to 12 % and for large circuits it is negligible . table 4 : comparison with area overhead . NL the experimental results ( table 4 ) clearly show that the proposed method can be implemented for large designs with low area hardware . 6 . summary and conclusion NL a novel atpg using ring counter with reduced dynamic power dissipation is proposed in this paper . the power consumption reduction is achieved by partial insertion of random bits at ls portion and partial freezing of remaining ms bits using external circuit . adding a simple external circuit ( constructed by basic xor , and gate , and 2 : 1 multiplexer ) the high transition test patterns are identified and the number of vertical transitions is reduced . ring counter is used as test pattern generator which makes test pattern generation method simple to understand . NL seed is applied in parallel using modified ff which can reduce the time for seed application . using switching transition counter , less correlative patterns are identified , which avoids unnecessary insertion of test vector in between all consecutive test patterns and reduces testing time . thus the consecutive test patterns that have few transitions only applied to the cut . this reduces dynamic power dissipation without affecting the fault coverage . this method proposes a simple atpg circuit using basic multiplexers and ring counter which generates low transition test patterns . therefore it can be expanded for large circuits easily . conflict of interests NL the authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper . references h . kilic and l . oktem , “ low -

NL it was different for the vlsi revolution in microelectronics ; perhaps it was the exciting visual artifacts , or the shared - sense of breaking new ground . whatever the reason , many participants saved old treasures from those years ( 1976 - 1980 ) – research notes , prototype silicon chips and chip photos , even huge color check plots – and stored them away for decades . during 2008 - 2010 , members of the original vlsi research team , along with colleagues in academia and industry , began gathering up , scanning and photographing such artifacts – and then posting them online . the resulting vlsi archive helps bring those exciting days back to life . the online vlsi archive spreadsheet enables easy access to its wide array of contents , and its mass of primary historical evidence also provided a great starting - point for writing a memoir about the work .

NL further more - detailed links to this information are contained in ( i ) a page of main links to key documents , ( ii ) a page of links re the impact of the mead - conway work and ( iii ) a spreadsheet of links into all the detailed book chapters , document sections and photos in the archive .   NL included in the archive is the series of ' 77 - ' 78 drafts of the text introduction to vlsi systems by mead and conway . these self - published drafts were used to document and test their evolving design methods prior to the formal publication of the textbook in late ' 79 . also included are the plan and lecture notes for the pioneering vlsi design course lynn conway taught at m . i . t . in 1978 . lynn compiled all that information into a " guide for the instructor of vlsi design " , enabling rapid propagation of her course in subsequent years . the archive also includes both the 1st and 2nd editions of the " guide to lsi implementation " , edited by hon and sequin , containing critical knowledge regarding fast - turnaround chip implementation developed by the mead - conway teams at xerox parc and caltech . NL the mead - conway text and the two guidebooks were used to launch vlsi design courses at 12 universities in the fall of 1979 . in advance of the courses , lynn and her team at parc innovated and implemented a new type of internet - based " vlsi implementation system " to support rapid - prototyping of large numbers of chip design projects . in a major internet - happening called " mpc79 " , the " mpc system " was deployed to support rapid prototyping of design projects from all 12 courses that fall . the archive includes many documents , data sheets and chip photos from mpc79 , all of which are accessible via vlsi archive spreadsheet . NL the success of mpc79 and the subsequent mcp580 set the stage for the rapid spread of the mead - conway methods into over 100 universities within a few short years . it also led to darpa sponsorship of vlsi research in the universities to follow - up on the mead - conway innovations and to darpa support of rapid - chip - prototyping via a new national - level service called " mosis " ( directly based on the mpc system technology   lynn pioneered at parc ) . for an overview of the development of the mead - conway methods and their rapid spread in the university and entrepreneurial communities , see " the mpc adventures " , by lynn conway . see also lynn ' s " vlsi reminiscences " for insights into the context of the time , the motivations for the mead - conway work , how it all got started and how it unfolded .   NL table of links :   NL note : see the vlsi archive spreadsheet for links to specific individual documents , pre - publication book chapters , all the mit78 and mpc79 chip - photos , etc . for more details on the unfolding of events , see the vlsi archive main links . NL in may 2008 , lynn met with archivists at the computer history museum in mountain view , ca to begin the process of archiving documents , photographs and artifacts from the mead - conway vlsi design revolution at the museum . this will be an ongoing process as further items are discovered . NL hardcopies of many key original documents have already been archived at the museum . we ' ll post a spreadsheet sometime soon that identifies which items have been placed there . NL

very - large - scale integration ( vlsi ) is the process of creating integrated circuits by combining thousands of transistor - based circuits into a single chip . vlsi began in the 1970s when complex semiconductor and communication technologies were being developed . NL the first semiconductor chips held one transistor each . subsequent advances added more and more transistors , and as a consequence more individual functions or systems were integrated over time . the microprocessor is a vlsi device . NL the first " generation " of computers relied on vacuum tubes . then came discrete semiconductor devices , followed by integrated circuits . the first small - scale integration ( ssi ) ics had small numbers of devices on a single chip - diodes , transistors , resistors and capacitors ( no inductors though ) , making it possible to fabricate one or more logic gates on a single device . the fourth generation consisted of large - scale integration ( lsi ) , i . e . systems with at least a thousand logic gates . the natural successor to lsi was vlsi ( many tens of thousands of gates on a single chip ) . current technology has moved far past this mark and today ' s microprocessors have many millions of gates and hundreds of millions of individual transistors .

in response to the increasing challenges in maintaining technology advancements through traditional scaling at a pace consistent with moore ' s law , alternative methods to achieve enhanced system level performance are becoming increasingly important . 3d technology has the potential to provide significant performance enhancements for several generations . realization of this technology will require collaborative research and development across system architecture , design , and technology . significant changes to the basic circuit design , layout procedures and tools flow , as well as the routing of global signals and supplies ( power / ground distribution , clock distribution , and i / o ) , will be required to accommodate the 3d technology features in stacked active chip designs . these changes can only be understood through a detailed evaluation of the impact of each of the unique 3d technology elements on the design . the research division is involved in leading the exploration of these new aspects of 3d vlsi chip design for future systems .

ieee 802 refers to a family of ieee standards dealing with local area networks and metropolitan area networks . NL more specifically , the ieee 802 standards are restricted to networks carrying variable - size packets . by contrast , in cell relay networks data is transmitted in short , uniformly sized units called cells . isochronous networks , where data is transmitted as a steady stream of octets , or groups of octets , at regular time intervals , are also out of the scope of this standard . the number 802 was simply the next free number ieee could assign , though “ 802 ” is sometimes associated with the date the first meeting was held — february 1980 . NL the services and protocols specified in ieee 802 map to the lower two layers ( data link and physical ) of the seven - layer osi networking reference model . in fact , ieee 802 splits the osi data link layer into two sub - layers named logical link control ( llc ) and media access control ( mac ) , so that the layers can be listed like this : NL data link layer NL llc sublayer NL mac sublayer NL physical layer NL the ieee 802 family of standards is maintained by the ieee 802 lan / man standards committee ( lmsc ) . the most widely used standards are for the ethernet family , token ring , wireless lan , bridging and virtual bridged lans . an individual working group provides the focus for each area . NL ieee developed a set of 802 network standards . they include : NL ieee 802 . 1 : standards related to network management . NL ieee 802 . 2 : general standard for the data link layer in the osi reference model . the ieee divides this layer into two sub - layers - - the logical link control ( llc ) layer and the media access control ( mac ) layer . the mac layer varies for different network types and is defined by standards ieee 802 . 3 through ieee 802 . 5 . NL ieee 802 . 3 : defines the mac layer for bus networks that use csma / cd . this is the basis of the ethernet standard . NL ieee 802 . 4 : defines the mac layer for bus networks that use a token - passing mechanism ( token bus networks ) . NL ieee 802 . 5 : defines the mac layer for token - ring networks .

design and realization of microelectronic systems using vlsi / ulsi technologies require close collaboration among scientists and engineers in the fields of systems architecture , logic and circuit design , chips and wafer fabrication , packaging , testing , and systems applications . generation of specifications , design , and verification must be performed at all abstraction levels , including the system , register - transfer , logic , circuit , transistor , and process levels . NL to address this critical area through a common forum , the ieee transactions on vlsi systems was founded . the editorial board , consisting of international experts , invites original papers which emphasize the novel system integration aspects of microelectronic systems , including interactions among system design and partitioning , logic and memory design , digital and analog circuit design , layout synthesis , cad tools , chips and wafer fabrication , testing and packaging , and system level qualification . thus , the coverage of this transactions focuses on vlsi / ulsi microelectronic system integration . NL topics of special interest include , but are not strictly limited to , the following : • system specification , design and partitioning , • system - level test , • reliable vlsi / ulsi systems , • high performance computing and communication systems , • wafer scale integration and multichip modules ( mcms ) , • high - speed interconnects in microelectronic systems , • vlsi / ulsi neural networks and their applications , • adaptive computing systems with fpga components , • mixed analog / digital systems , • cost , performance tradeoffs of vlsi / ulsi systems , • adaptive computing using reconfigurable components ( fpgas )   NL a not - for - profit organization , ieee is the world ' s largest professional association for the advancement of technology .

concurrency & vlsi NL " simplicity is the ultimate sophistication . " NL - leonardo da vinci research in alain martin ' s lab is about developing design methods that can cope with the increasing complexity of modern computing systems - - hardware or software - - with an emphasis in the areas of concurrency and asynchronous vlsi . our interest in vlsi was triggered by the observation that a modern vlsi circuit is mostly a complex distributed system on a chip . other research topics include concurrent algorithms , languages , and semantics ; and parallel machine architectures . NL asynchronous vlsi - - currently , our main research topic is asynchronous vlsi . a digital circuit is called " asynchronous " when it doesn ' t use a clock , and therefore such circuits lend themselves perfectly to a high - level synthesis approach . we believe that the complexity and brittleness of today ' s vlsi systems requires new design methods based on asynchronous techniques , concurrency , high - level synthesis , and verification . read more . . . NL concurrency in computation - - concurrency has been the leading thread of the group research , and the theoretical basis on which the caltech asynchronous design method was built . some of the concurrency work predates the asynchronous vlsi activity , including : NL the introduction of the notion of slack and the probe construct . NL various concurrent algorithms , among which : " on - the - fly garbage collection " ( as one of ewd ' s co - authors ) , distributed mutual exclusion with message - passing , a generalization of dekker ' s algorithm for mutual exclusion with shared variables . NL the work on message - passing parallel machine architectures and the " processing surface " paradigm . NL some of the concurrency work was developed as part of the asynchronous vlsi activity , like : NL the design of the concurrent language chp . NL synthesis by program transformations .
